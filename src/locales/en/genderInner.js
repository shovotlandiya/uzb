    text1:
      "<p>Alisher Navoiy (1441-1501) - a great poet and thinker, a statesman. His full name is Nizomiddin Mir Alisher. Navoiy composed in two languages, Chagatai (Old Uzbek language) and Persian (in his works in the Persian language). He is considered one of the most prominent figures in Uzbek literature and is esteemed among all Turkic peoples. Throughout his life, Navoiy was a close friend of the ruler Husayn Boyqaro of Khorasan (Transoxiana) during his youth. He began writing poems at the age of 10-12.</p><p> According to historical records left by his contemporary historian Khondamir (1473(76)-1534), the famous Uzbek poet Lutfiy (1369-1465) acknowledged Navoiy's poetic talent during his early years and praised his poetic abilities highDuring his lifetime, Navoiy lived in various Muslim regions of the East and met with renowned personalities of his era. He developed his poetic skills and, in 1464-1465, his initial poetic collection (divans) was prepared by his admirers. It became apparent that during those times, Navoiy had already gained fame as a distinguished poet. Until 1469, due to internal conflicts among the Timurids, Navoiy was compelled to move away from his hometown, Herat, and settled in a distant city.</p><p> In 1469, the Timurid ruler Husayn Boyqaro captured Herat and became the ruler of Khorasan. From that time on, a new phase began in Navoiy's life. He actively participated in the political life of the state. In the same year, Husayn Boyqaro appointed Navoiy as the state's chief minister (muhrdar), and in 1472, he became the vizier. In his position, Navoiy played a significant role in the cultural and intellectual development of the state. He held vast estates and used his wealth to build several madrasas, 40 inns (caravanserais) for travelers, 17 mosques, 10 Sufi hospices (khanaqahs), 9 baths, 9 bridges, and more in Herat and other provinces. However, the courtiers around the ruler did not appreciate Navoiy's activities, and through various intrigues, they soured Husayn Boyqaro's relations with him.Thus, Navoiy was dismissed from his high position, but in 1487, he was appointed as the ruler of the city of Astrabad.</p><p> He served there for two years. After this period, Husayn Boyqaro returned Navoiy to Herat and offered him another high position (mukarrabi khazrati sultani), which granted Navoiy the right to decide on all state affairs. From this time, Navoiy entered a new phase in his life and engaged in more creative work. A significant part of his literary works belongs to this period when he lived during the reign of the Timurids (1370-1506). Therefore, his works extensively reflect the societal and intellectual issues of that time. From 1490 to 1501, Navoiy produced his most exquisite, social- philosophical, and scientific works.Alisher Navoiy's creative output was immense. His six collections (divans) comprise over 60,000 verses. Between 1483 and 1485, Navoiy compiled his famous Hamsa, consisting of five epic poems: Hayrat ul-Abror (The Amazement of the Wise Men), Farhod va Shirin (Farhad and Shirin), Layli va Majnun, Sab’ai sayyor (The Seven Planets), and Saddi Iskandariy (Alexander's Wall). Navoiy's Hamsa is considered the first significant work in the Turkic language in this genre. It proved that such large-scale compositions could be created in Turkic. Moreover, Navoiy demonstrated this ability in the Chagatai language as well. It was an accomplishment that allowed him to rise to prominence.Navoiy delved into the various genres of Eastern literature and showcased his unique voice and style in his writings. In Eastern literature, there were over 120 different versions of the Layli va Majnun narrative.</p><p> Navoiy added his personal touch to this story, portraying the love between Layli and Majnun and expressing his humanistic and Sufi ideas. Similar themes of mysticism were present in his other epics such as Farhod va Shirin and Hayrat ul-Abror. His epics presented humanistic problems inherent in that period, reflecting the impermanence of the world and the responsibilities of the ruler towards his people. Contrary to Hamsanafis (the traditional five ghazals) poetic traditions, Navoiy stood out with his distinct societal and political commitment and individualNavoiy's impact on the literary and intellectual life of Central Asia was vast. His Hamsa was repeatedly copied and disseminated.</p> Today, there are 166 manuscripts of the Hamsa or its separate epics stored in the Abu Rayhon Beruni Institute of Oriental Studies. Among them, 84 manuscripts are complete versions of the epics. Navoiy's Hamsa played a crucial role in elevating the literary culture of Central Asia to a new level.Throughout his life, Alisher Navoiy harmoniously combined literature with politics. As a prominent figure, he actively contributed to the socio-economic development of the state, promoted science, art, and provided support to cultural advancement. He continuously strove for peace and stability in the country. Navoiy's literary legacy enriched Uzbek (Chagatai) literature, advancing it to new heights. His poems were diverse, encompassing worldly and religious themes, as well as Sufism. Navoiy also wrote religious works, such as Arbain (Forty Rubaiyat) and Munadjat (Supplication to Allah).His work Nasaim al-muhabbat (The Breath of Love) is an example of Sufi prose, providing information on 750 Sufi sheikhs. Navoiy also composed scholarly works, including those related to Arabic and Turkic language comparisons: Muhokamat al-lug'atayn (The Comparison of Two Languages); works on the theory of prosody (the measurement of verse) such as Mezon al-avzan (Measure of Verses); and works on the genre theory of a poem (jumboq) Mufradat (The Rhyming Dictionary). Additionally, Navoiy wrote historical treatises such as Tarixi muluki Adjam (The History of Iranian Kings) and Tarixi anbiya va xukama (History of Prophets and Rulers). His letters and correspondences were compiled into the collection 'Munshaat.One of his remarkable works is 'Mahbub ul-qulub' (1500), which reflects Navoiy's final social and political views.",

      "<p>Jalal al-Din Magburni (Jalal ad-Diniya wa-Din Abu al-Muzaffar Mankburni ibn Muhammad) (1199—1- since 1220, he took the name Jalal al-Din Mekburni (or Manguberdi), which means 'light on his face.' The exact date of Jalal al-Din's birth is unknown, but his official designated birthdate is 1198. He was born in the city of Gurganj and belonged to the royal family of the Khwarezmshah Ala ad-Din Muhammad II and his Turkmen wife Oychechak. After the Mongol invasion in 1220, Jalal al-Din's small brother, O'zloqxon, sat on the throne in Gurganj while his father was saved from the chaos.</p><p> Jalal al-Din grew up in a military environment and developed his skills in warfare at an early age.When the Mongols threatened the region near Gurganj, Jalal al-Din's father sought refuge, leaving Jalal al-Din behind to guard the city. Jalal al-Din engaged in relentless battles with enemies and eventually emerged as a formidable leader. He faced challenges and fought countless wars against various adversaries, leading his army to confrontations without hesitation.Upon hearing news of Chingiz Khan's conquests, Jalal al-Din sent his brother to Sirdaryo to seek help, but his father refused to send the army to that location, opting not to gather his forces. The Mongols attacked and captured his father, compelling Jalal al-Din to take control of Gurganj.</p><p> After his father's death, Jalal al-Din assumed the throne, but the original elites of Gurganj rebelled against him and forced him to flee the city.Jalal al-Din then raised a small army of three hundred loyal Turkmen warriors and set his course towards Khorasan. Along the way, they encountered and defeated a Mongol detachment, gaining reputation and respect from the local population. As a result, the city of Bokhara fell under his control, followed by Samarqand. The great historian Muhammad Kaspiy was taken captive by Jalal al-Din. He gathered his three brothers and asked them to obey him, choosing him as the leader. After his brother's death, Jalal al-Din ascended to the throne, but the original elites of Gurganj remained unsatisfied and opposed him, leading to the departure of the populace's support.</p><p>He gathered a coalition of three hundred brave Turkmen warriors and proceeded towards Khorasan. Near Nisa, they encountered and defeated the Mongols, easily vanquishing them. This victory sparked a sense of pride and resistance among the people of Khurasan against the Mongol invaders, prompting Chingiz Khan to dispatch his forces to Khwarezm and Khorasan, where Jalal al-Din's smaller brothers were killed, and they were buried with his bow.</p><p> Afterward, Chingiz Khan himself led an army against Jalal al-Din but, instead of engaging in a battle, Jalal al-Din chose to withdraw, avoiding direct confrontation.He formed an alliance with Malik Shah of Marv and his forty-thousand Turkmen army. They gathered near Kandahar and defeated the Mongols, driving them out of Ghazni (present-day Afghanistan). Jalal al-Din then captured Ghazni, followed by Bokhara and later Samarqand. He faced stiff resistance from the Mongols, but he managed to defeat them. Initially, in 1220, he conquered Bukhara, then Samarqand. Soon, he moved towards Gurganj and defeated the rebellious elites, securing his control over the region. Jalal al-Din continued his campaign, conquering Balkh and advancing towards the territory of Khurasan.</p><p> Near Qandahar, he was joined by a group of seven hundred warriors, and together, they defeated the Mongols, forcing them to retreat. These triumphs strengthened the resolve of the people of Khorasan against the Mongol invaders, prompting Chingiz Khan to send more troops to Khwarezm and Khorasan, along with a large force led by Jalal al-Din's brothers.In the Battle of Parwana, Jalal al-Din's forces clashed with the main Mongol army under the command of Shigi Kutuktu. The Mongol army was almost completely annihilated, leaving only a few soldiers alSubsequently, Jalal al-Din was forced to retreat and sought refuge in the mountains of Khorasan, where he was eventually killed.Despite the defeat, Jalal al-Din's bravery and the resistance of his army made a lasting impression on the Mongols and earned him the title of a national hero. He is revered as a symbol of bravery and resistance in Uzbekistan, and monuments and memorials have been dedicated to him across the country.In 1999, the 800th anniversary of Jalal al-Din's birth was widely celebrated in Uzbekistan.</p> Monuments and statues were erected in his honor, and a memorial complex dedicated to Jalal al-Din Manguberdi was established in the region of Khorezm.In the same year, special 25 som commemorative coins were issued to mark the occasion of Jalal al- Din's 800th birth anniversary.Furthermore, on August 30, 2000, the 'Order of Jalal al-Din Manguberdi' was established to recognize individuals and military units who demonstrated exceptional bravery, heroism, and military skills in defending the independence and borders of the country. It is bestowed upon those who have contributed significantly to strengthening the defense capabilities of the state.",

      "On August 22, 2003, the region of Khorezm was awarded with the aforementioned 'Order of Jalal al- Din Manguberdi' for their valor and contributions to the nation. He is also highly respected in Turkmenistan, where he is celebrated as a national hero for his bravery and resistance against the Mongol invasion. Jalal al-Din's remarkable exploits in history have left a significant impact, and his memory continues to be cherished and commemorated in both Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. He is remembered as a valiant warrior who bravely stood against the forces of Genghis Khan, becoming a symbol of national pride and courage for the people of Central Asia. His legacy serves as an enduring inspiration for future generations to stand up against tyranny and defend their homeland with unwavering determination.",

      "<p>Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Abdallah ibn Al-Hassan ibn Sina was a prominent scholar, physician, and musician. He lived in Central Asia and the Middle East and served as a physician and vizier during the rule of various rulers. ibn Sina's works were famous in both the East and West, with his medical encyclopedia 'The Canon of Medicine' being widely used for several centuries, even in EuroHis main interests included staying up-to-date with modern medical developments, homeopathy, folk medicine, and studying contemporary medical sources and medical-related references.</p> <p> Abu Ali Al- Hussein ibn Sina's death occurred over a century ago, and his philosophical books were cherished by Sufis in Baghdad, leading to their translation and further dissemination in Europe, where a significant compilation of the 'The Canon of Medicine' was published as the second edition after the Bible.The Sultan of Medicine, Abu Ali ibn Sina, was born near Bukhara in the Afshona region. In his autobiography, he writes, 'I was born in Balx, and it was during the reign of Nuh Ibn Mansur when I came to Bukhara, where I began my work from the devonkhana (a place for scholars). My role was to administer the central district of Xarmaysan, which is close to Bukhara. It was there that I married a from the neighboring Afshona, who later became my beloved wife Sitora. She will give birth to my future son Husayn. My family and I were not from the elite class.'He was fluent in Farsi, which was the common language of the Central Asian region.</p> <p> In this language, he often wrote quatrains. Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Sina's parents had a great fondness for the name Husayn. Hence, they named their first son Husayn, but in local customs, it was common to give the sons and titles of pride to their children. So, Abdulloh said, 'Undoubtedly, my son will have his own son, so I call him Abdulloh. Accordingly, my son Husayn will not have any grief. For the future, I have chosen the name Ali for him. His kunya will be Abu Ali.' Abdulloh didn't know the real reason behind this choice, but Husayn would not become a grandfather or have a family of his own.Throughout his life, Hussein journeyed through cities and towns, often moving from one ruler's court to another, and people from all walks of life would gather around him or his family members. Husayn was a curious and inquisitive child.</p><p> The word 'Nima uchun?' (Why?) was the most frequently used word in his vocabulary. When he turned five, his family moved to Bukhara. He enrolled in the initial Muslim maktab, where students had to learn to read and recite verses and chapters of the Quran in Arabic. Most boys learned Arabic but had a limited understanding. Husayn, however, actively engaged with his teacher, asking many questions, but the teacher always responded, 'Learn the Quran, and you will find answers to all your questions.' At some point, Hussein started studying with another teacher, learning grammar, rhetoric, and the Arabic language.One day, when young Hussein said, 'I have memorized the whole Quran. Now, can I ask a question?', his teacher was taken aback and said, 'It takes many years to learn the Quran thoroughly, and only a few Muslims can be called hafiz.' Husayn replied promptly, 'Then, I am a hafiz!' At the unjust exam, he recited all the chapters without missing a single word.The teacher, Ubayd, was also aware of the Quran, which Husayn had memorized. After that incident, Husayn never returned to the maktab. At the age of ten, around 990 AD, Husayn's initial education came to an end. With a remarkable memory for the Quran and a remarkable knowledge of Arabic literature, Abu Ali Al-Hussein became a notable scholar. </p><p>At this time, he was titled 'Shaykh.' Here's an excerpt from his personal statement: 'At the age of ten, I memorized the Quran and studied literature, achieving great success in my studies. I left no stone unturned.'It is worth mentioning that Hussein's extraordinary abilities were recognized at an early age. His pleasant character and moral elevation were noticed within the confines of his home. Although Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Sina was not an Ismaili (a sect opposed to Islam) himself, he was closely related to Ismaili acquaintances. While he did not share Ismaili beliefs, he was intrigued by their eloquent speeches. It is likely that ibn Sina projected his critical views of the Quran onto the Ismailis.Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Abdallah ibn Al-Hassan ibn Sina's first teacher in philosophy and mathematics was Abu Abdullah an-Natili, who happened to be his childhood friend. However, as their education progressed, Abu Ali Al-Hussein started questioning his teacher's explanations, leading to some uneasy moments between them. Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Sina describes this situation in his own words: 'I analyzed this definition to such an extent that I had never heard anything like it before. He left me in a state of great confusion, and my parents advised me not to involve myself in anything other than knowledge Later, I also encountered a similar situation with Euclid's book. With the guidance oteacher, I learned five or six theorems, but the rest I learned independently.</p><p> Soon after, Natili gave up on teaching me. He said, 'Learn on your own, derive the theorems yourself, then come to me.' From that point on, I studied the books independently. During this time, I encountered so many questions that even my teacher couldn't answer, and ultimately, I surpassed hAl-Hussein had a keen interest in medicine from an early age, and this passion for the field continued to grow. By the age of 12, he had already gained substantial knowledge through the guidance of Abu Salah al-Masihi, a philosopher and physician of the time. ibn Sina writes, 'Then, I set my heart on becoming a physician and began to study medical books ' - as stated in his autobiography.Medicine didn't prove to be a difficult field for him, and he quickly mastered the subject. His medical knowledge expanded so rapidly that the physicians of his time would seek his advice, and he became renowned for providing innovative treatments. When the ruler of Bukhara, Nuh ibn Mansur, fell seriously ill, he called on Ibn Sina to treat him.In Ibn Sina's own words, he narrates, 'One day, the ruler fell severely ill, and the physicians were unable to diagnose his condition. They were acquainted with me and came to me, asking me to attend to the ruler. I went to the place where I was summoned and provided medical treatment.' The ruler's condition improved, and Ibn Sina was granted permission to access the Samanid library, which housed a treasure trove of books. The library in Bukhara was considered the largest and most famous repository of books of its time.</p>Ibn Sina considers the period when he worked in the Bukhara library as the most crucial stage of his intellectual development. During this time, his education came to a close, and he embarked on an independent path in life. For several years, Ibn Sina made extensive use of the Samanid library, where he found all kinds of medical treatises and the compilation of various medical knowledge. It is likely that during his stay at the library, he gathered information on different subjects, including the reasons and treatments for diseases, ultimately leading to the creation of his comprehensive medical work.To achieve this goal, Ibn Sina compiled various fragments from different books and references, making generalizations. Thus, his most significant work, 'The Canon of Medicine,' was prepared using materials gathered from different sources, and he worked on this task for many years.In 999, his father, Abdullah ibn Hassan, passed away, and Ibn Sina was tasked with the responsibility of comforting his relatives. Unfortunately, the ruling elite of the former Ismaili sect harbored suspicions about his family, leaving Ibn Sina in a dire situation. As a result, he decided to leave Bukhara for the capital of Khorezm, Gurganj.Regrettably, Abu Ali Al-Hussein ibn Sina would not return to his homeland again. He traveled from one city to another, visiting places such as Khorezm, Abiverd, Nishapur, Tua, Gurgan, Rey, and Hamadan. He experienced many hardships during his life, often rising to prominent positions in the government or facing imprisonment, both in peacetime and during wars. He was sometimes a vizier and sometimes thrown into dungeons, alternating between being celebrated and despised. Despite these challenges, he never gave up on his creative and intellectual endeavors.In 1002, Bukhara was attacked by Turkic tribes, and the Samanid dynasty fell, forcing Ibn Sina to flee to Urgench. He resided there for a while under the patronage of the ruler, who granted him the title 'Chief of Physicians.' In 1008, he began his service to Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, a prosperous period marked by extensive travels. He wrote some of his works during these journeys.",
    text2:
      "From 1015 to 1024, he resided in Hamadan, engaging actively in both intellectual and political affairs. He became the chief physician and counselor to Amir Shams ad-Davlani. However, due to the political instability, he had to leave the region. He was arrested for a short period and spent some time in prison for his critical views expressed in his works, particularly in 'Kitab ul-insaf' (The Book of Justice). In 1037, Ibn Sina passed away, leaving a will where he liberated all his slaves and requested that his wealth be distributed to the poor. Avicenna's body was buried outside the city walls of Hamadan. After eight months, his remains were moved to Isfahan, and he was laid to rest near the tomb of the sultan's mother. Ibn Sina's life was a testament to his insatiable thirst for knowledge and his profound intellect. He possessed an extraordinary memory and a sharp philosophical mind.",

      "<p>Al-Farabi, whose full name was Abu Nasr ibn Muhammad, was a philosopher, encyclopedist, astronomer, mathematician, and one of the prominent scholars of the Middle Ages in the Islamic world. He was considered one of the primary representatives of the Eastern medieval scholars. He held the title of 'Second Teacher' (after Aristotle), and his major works include 'The Jewels of Wisdom,' 'Treatise on the Views of the Inhabitants of a Virtuous City,' 'Classification of Sciences,' and 'The Great Book of MusiBorn in 870 (or according to some sources, 872), Al-Farabi hailed from a distinguished Turkic family in the city of Farab, located near the Syr Darya River in present-day Uzbekistan. He left his hometown early in life to pursue knowledge, and it is reported that he traveled to various places such as Baghdad, Khurasan, Damascus, Aleppo, and other cities under the Arab Caliphate.During his formative years, Al-Farabi spent considerable time in Baghdad, which was then the political and cultural center of the Arab Caliphate.</p><p> There, he immersed himself in the study of 'Bayt al-Hikmah,' the House of Wisdom, where he learned Greek philosophical works and translated them into Arabic. He acquainted himself with prominent scholars and established himself as a leading intellectual with remarkable acumen and profound insight. During this period, he earned the title of 'Muallim Assana' or the Second Teacher (considered the second after Aristotle).Al-Farabi's intellectual curiosity was vast and eclectic, encompassing a broad range of subjects. He delved into logic at an early age and eventually contributed to the field independently. His philosophical perspective significantly differed from mainstream opinions of his time, as he embraced Greek philosophy and sciences wholeheartedly. Some of his unorthodox ideas led to criticism from orthodox scholars, who accused him of innovation and straying from religious doctrine. However, his unique philosophical approach was rooted in independent thinking and firm conviction.</p> <p>In Baghdad, Al-Farabi also engaged with other leading scholars, most notably Abu Bishr Matt ben Yunis, who considered Al-Farabi to be his successor in the field of logic. Al-Farabi further honed his philosophical insights and mastered the legacy of Aristotle, triumphing over various Greek puzzles and problems.His work 'Classification of Sciences' (Ihsa' al-Ulum) is indicative of his extensive scientific research. In this treatise, he systematically categorized all the sciences of his time and provided detailed explanations for each discipline.In Baghdad, Al-Farabi was revered for his knowledge and held in high regard by prominent scholars. However, his ideas clashed with the religious inclinations of some scholars, which led to tension and ultimately compelled him to leave the city.He traveled to Damascus, and from there, he proceeded to Egypt.</p> The extensive journey of Al-Farabi is reflected in his work 'Fuqara Siyosati' (The Politics of the Poor), which he began in Baghdad and completed in Qusayr, Egypt. In this work, he criticized the political situation in Baghdad and, in the placed his hopes on Qusayr in Egypt. The exact circumstances surrounding his departure from Damascus and his stay in Qusayr are not well-documented, but he spent the later part of his life in seclusion.Al-Farabi's extensive scholarly contributions covered approximately 80 to 130 works, highlighting his dedication to understanding the structure of the world. He posited that the knowledge of the essence could only be attained through intellect, and human understanding was limited in this regard.",

      " <p>Mirzo Muhammad ibn Shahrukh ibn Temur Ulugbek Gurgani (1394-1449) - a great astronomer and mathematician, a renowned scholar of his time, a state ruler, and the governor of Movarounnahr from 1441 to 1449. He was a famous ruler and a distinguished descendant of Amir Temur (Temur), born as Muhammad Taragai on March 22, 1394, in the city of Sultaniya, which is now in present-day Azerbaijan. In 1405, after the death of the great conqueror who established a vast empire stretching from Central Asia to the entire region of South and Central East, encompassing the Caspian Sea to the Southern Indian subcontinent, the entire imperial legacy passed on to his sons and heirs. Shahrukh, the son of Temur, inherited the throne of the Temurid EmpiAs the governor of Movarounnahr, Shahrukh's eldest son, Ulugbek, was assigned to rule the region. In 1409, Ulugbek was declared the ruler of Samarqand, succeeding his father Shahrukh after his death. </p><p>In 1447, he became the head of the Temurid dynasty.During his youth, Ulugbek displayed a keen interest in various fields of knowledge, particularly in mathematics and astronomy. His intellectual curiosity led him to amass a vast collection of books and establish a significant library, where he spent much of his time. Ulugbek received a comprehensive and rigorous education, becoming proficient in Arabic and Persian languages, well-versed in Turkish jurisprudence, and actively participating in literary discussions. He even composed poetry himself. One of Ulugbek's most famous mentors was the renowned mathematician and astronomer Ghiyath al-Din Jamshid al-Kashi, known as Qozizoda Rumiy, who presented him with the famous observatory instruments from Maragha at the age of eighteen. These memories from his early years might have played a crucial role in shaping his future as an astronomer.Ulugbek's era was known for its flourishing intellectual achievements, particularly in science and arts, in the city of Samarqand. During the first half of the 15th century, Ulugbek's patronage brought together prominent astronomers and mathematicians such as Ghiyath al-Din Jamshid al-Kashi, Ali Quscreating a distinguished center of learning.</p><p> Samarqand also hosted notable historians like Hafiz Abru, skilled physicians like Mavlono Nefis, and poets like Sirojiddin Samarqandiy, Sakkokiy, Lutfiy, Badakhshi, and others. These individuals were the intellectual giants of their time, contributing significantly to the advancement of knowledge.Between 1417 and 1420, Ulugbek built a madrasa (Islamic school) in Samarqand, which became the first memorial ensemble listed on the Registry. This madrasa and the two others he constructed in Gijduvan and Bukhara were like universities of their time. The inscription on the entrance of the madrasa in Bukhara reads, 'The pursuit of knowledge is a duty for every Muslim.'However, Ulugbek's true passion lay in astronomy. He cooperated with astronomers and scholars like Qozizoda Rumiy, Jamshid Ghiyosiddin al-Kashi, Ali Qushji, to construct an observatory.According to the opinions of researching scholars, the construction of the observatory was completed in 1428-1429. The observatory was a rare architectural marvel of its time.</p><p> To ensure its stability, the building site was carefully selected to be on a rocky foundation on the Qohak hillside. The main instrument used was a sextant (angle measuring device) designed to measure along the meridian lines from south to north. Apart from the primary instrument, there were other astronomical instruments present in the observatory.Likely, the size and convenient design of the sextant allowed for precise astronomical observations, and Ulugbek's knowledge and patronage might have contributed to its development.</p><p> Under the leadership and participation of the great astronomer Ulugbek, the primary purpose of the observatory was to compile the 'Zij-i Kurgani' (Ulugbek's star catalogue). In this book, the positions of approximately 1,018 stars were recorded, starting with the Gippar (Spica). The creation of this astronomical catalog is considered a significant contribution to the treasure trove of world astronomy.Furthermore, the observatory conducted tasks like determining the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator and calculating the length of a sidereal year. It also performed calculations involving the importance of the sine at a particular angle - crucial for astronomical constants - up to the eighteenth figure after the decimal point.Ulugbek accomplished the accurate calculation of the length of a sidereal year, stating it as 365 days, 6 hours, 10 minutes, and 8 seconds in 1437. Later, the difference in measurements turned out to be 58 seconds. Considering that the actual length of a sidereal year is 31,558,150 seconds, one can appreciate the remarkable accuracy of Ulugbek's calculations.In addition to being a great scholar, Ulugbek was a benevolent ruler. He dedicated most of his time to the observatory and allocated less time for state affairs. His son, Abdulatif, under the influence of spiritual leaders, rebelled against him. Abdulatif suggested that his father embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca. In accordance with the Sharia law, Ulugbek was assassinated during his Hajj in 1449.Even after the great Ulugbek's untimely death, his shining star did not fade away. His dedicated student Ali Qushji, under the pressure of his mother leaving Samarqand, took Ulugbek's 'Zij-i Kurgani' to Europe. Later, the book gained recognition among various generations of scholars. Ulugbek's name and achievements became famous among European and Asian scholars. In the 17th century, the French astronomer, Jean-Baptiste Morin, published a work titled 'Les Tables Astronomiques d'Uluq Beg,' in which he presented the astronomical tables of Ulugbek.The publication of Ulugbek's tables in Europe attracted attention and was widely acclaimed for their accuracy.</p> They were considered a compass for historians and astronomers, helping them undersancient chronology. Later, the tables were further refined, and in 1665, an English translation, titled 'Tabulae Long, as Lat. Stellarum Fixarum, ex observatione Ulugh Beighi,' was printed in Oxford.The publication of Ulugbek's tables in Europe was a significant and arduous endeavor, demanding extensive research and calculations. It received high praise from respected figures and earned acclaim from celestial researchers.Over the years, Ulugbek's star tables found their way into numerous works, such as the 'Prodromus Astronomiae' by the Polish astronomer Jan Heweliusz (Johannes Hevelius), published in Gdansk in 1662.In 1839, the French orientalist Léon Cahun (1808-1876) partially published Ulugbek's star catalogue in his work titled 'Tables astronomiques d'Oloug Beg, commentées et publiées avec le texte en regard' (Astronomical Tables of Ulugbek, with Commentary and Text).And finally, in 1917, the more precise analysis of the Ulugbek table based on the study of eight manuscripts preserved in British libraries was published under the title 'Ulugh Beg's Catalogue of Stars. Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain,' authored by E. B. Knobel in the United States.It is worth mentioning that numerous copies of the 'Zij' are stored in European and Asian book repositories. Ulugbek's star catalogue became the final word in astronomy during the Middle Ages, predating the invention of the telescope and standing as the pinnacle of astronomical knowledge of its time.Ulugbek's significant scholarly legacy attests that he was not merely a great Muslim prince but an exceptional intellectual whose genius contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human knowledge and civilization. For this reason, his name has remained a symbol uniting both Eastern and Western nations with the noble purpose of promoting knowledge and understanding across centuries.Mirzo Ulugbek's profound and enlightening legacy is still studied and revered in leading educational institutions and scientific centers worldwide. The fact that the First President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, bestowed the title of this distinguished scholar on the Uzbek National University acknowledges the country's current intellectual and cultural prowess.",

      "<p>Zahriddin Muhammad Babur (1483-1530), a prominent figure of the Middle Ages, was not only a talented writer, poet, and scholar but also a distinguished ruler and leader. With his vast knowledge and wisdom, he established the Baburids dynasty, which ruled over a significant portion of Hindustan, and his name remains associated with the renowned work 'Baburnama,' which is considered a masterpiece in world historiograpBabur's exquisite ghazals and rubaiyat are among the rare gems of Turkish poetry, with 'Mubayyin' ('The Revealer'), 'Khutgi Baburiy,' 'Harb Ishi,' and his treatises on prosody making valuable contributions to Islamic jurisprudence, literature, and linguistics.Historical records suggest that when Babur marched towards Hindustan, he faced challenges from the local rulers, particularly the Punjab governors who were displeased with the policies of the Delhi ruler Ibrahim Sultan.</p><p> However, the Punjab rulers joined forces with Babur, resulting in his triumph at the Battle of Sikri and the establishment of his rule in Hindustan. The Baburids dynasty continued to rule over Hindustan for more than three centuries.After this victory, Babur did not live long—passing away in December 1530 in the city of Agra. According to his will, his remains were taken to Kabul by his son and buried there.His contributions to state affairs were remarkable. He personally worked towards stabilizing the political environment in Hindustan, unifying territories, developing cities, and rectifying trade and economic issues.</p><p> The memorials, gardens, libraries, and caravanserais built under his rule, especially during the time of his sons and descendants, expanded, testifying to his achievements. The infiltration of Central Asian style into Indian art and architecture began during his era. Under the patronage of him and his ruling descendants, a rich cultural and spiritual atmosphere flourished, with accomplished intellectuals, poets, musicians, and statesmen adorning that era.Babur also continued his literary and artistic pursuits amid his significant state affairs, creating the works mentioned above. 'Baburnama' is his famous autobiographical literary masterpiece. It covers the historical events that occurred during Babur's lifetime in Central Asia, Khorasan, Iran, and Hindustan. The book is divided into three parts: the first section narrates events witnessed by Babur during the second half of the 15th century in Central Asia; the second section covers events in the late 15th and early 16th centuries in the Kabul region (Afghanistan); and the third section is devoted to the history of North Indian regions in the early 16th century.When reading 'Baburnama,' we come across various details of Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Hindustan, such as geographical descriptions of Fergana province, the political and economic situation of his capital Andijan, and the major cities of Central Asia, including Samarkand, Bukhara, Karshi, Shahrisabz, Tashkent, Urgench, Termez, and others.</p> The book also presents information about the significant cities of Kabul, Ghazni, and their surrounding districts in Afghanistan. If we delve into 'Baburnama,' we gain insights into the virtues and shortcomings peculiar to the peoples of Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Hindustan, their cultural richness and complexity, as well as the socio-political life of the Baburids' realm. Besides recounting historical events and incidents in detail, 'Baburnama' reflects Babur's inner struggles, feelings, and aspirations, which are evident in his poetry. In his lyrical works, one can sense the essence of his love for the homeland, his longing for it, and his hope to return. Babur's poetic compositions eloquently express themes of patriotism, justice, humanism, and appreciation for the noble sentiments of people. For instance, he calls upon individuals to uphold goodness, justice, and human kindness.",
    text2:
      "Babur's poems also highlight the sentiments of yearning, beauty, the pain of separation, and the joys of reunion. His lyrical poetry displays an exquisite and delicate expression of these emotions. As a poet, he contributed greatly to Islamic jurisprudence and Sufism, producing valuable works.In conclusion, Babur, the just ruler and great poet, left an indelible mark in history as a scholarly author who weaved his literary and poetic creations with historical accounts and social issues. He remains a timeless symbol of courage, loyalty, patriotism, and devotion to his homeland and descendants. We, the students of Tashkent State University, learn from our great compatriot about bravery, loyalty, patriotism, and accountability to family and descendants.",

Despite his unremarkable appearance, he was a keen intellect and was eventually noticed by the vizier and tutor of the Khwarazmshah.His primary mentor in astronomy, mathematics, and trigonometry was Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Iroq al- Jadiy. Beruniy's works initially focused on mathematics and astronomy and included valuable treatises on terrestrial measurement and trade routes.</p><p>In his time, the field of astronomy was concerned with completing the planetary model and accurately measuring the position of celestial bodies in the sky. Determining the precise locations of the Sun and Moon relative to the Earth, the length of solar and lunar years, and other astronomical constants were essential tasks. These were inextricably linked to the development of mathematical theories, including both planar and spherical trigonometry.Abu Reikhan Muhammad Akhmad al-Beruniy made significant contributions to these fields, which remained unmatched for centuries.

Maturidi considered the Quran as an eternal word of God and believed that righteous individuals, even in this transient world, can attain divine blessings. Human actions are executed by God according to His knowledge, power, and will, and humans are held accountable for their choices and actions. However, unlike Mu'tazilites, who believed that humans had the capacity to choose, Maturidi believed that humans did not possess the ability to choose independently and that belief in God is attained through religious rites, not through rational speculations. Moreover, he considered the concept of eternity not based solely on God's signs but also on the everlasting nature of human actions.The Maturidi school of thought is one of the most significant theological schools in Islamic history, and its teachings continue to influence Muslims worldwide.In the year 2000, in honor of the 1130th anniversary of the birth of Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, Uzbekistan celebrated this milestone with various events, including international conferences and the opening of a memorial collection in Samarqand.

However, considering that he lived for a long time, possibly between 116 and 120 years, he is believed to have been born in the mid-8th century (approximately 750-760 AD). His tomb, located near the city of Termez, has inscriptions mentioning his death in the year 255 AH (869 AD).Al-Hakim at-Termiziy was a renowned scholar in various fields of Islamic knowledge. Termez, his birthplace, was one of the most prominent and flourishing cities in the region during the 9th century.

His father was not only a caring and loving parent but also a demanding mentor and knowledgeable teacher. In one of his books, al-Hakim at-Termiziy narrates a touching story about his early education: 'When I was eight years old, Allah willed that I developed a strong desire for acquiring knowledge. Studying books became my primary occupation, and unfortunately, I lost interest in playing games or spending time leisurely. </p>I devoted myself entirely to the study of 'Ilm al-usul' (knowledge of the origins of hadith) and 'Ilm ar-ray' (knowledge of beliefs)After his father's passing, al-Hakim at-Termiziy traveled to the city of Baghdad, a prominent center of knowledge in the Eastern world at that time. During his journey, he had the intention of acquiring more knowledge. However, a remarkable event occurred that left a lasting impact on him. His mother accompanied him on the trip, and at one point, she fell seriously ill. As they were stranded without anyone to care for her, she turned to her son and said, 'My dear son, if there is no one else who would take care of me as a weak and helpless woman, my entire well-being relies solely on you.

The shaykh asked al-Hakim about the reason for his grief, and the young scholar shared his story. The shaykh said, 'If you wish, I can teach you various sciences daily.' Al-Hakim accepted the offer gratefully, and this extraordinary encounter continued for several years. This account of al-Hakim at-Termiziy's life has been narrated in different ways in various sources, and it may have elements of truth or legend. However, it reflects a deep sense of respect and reverence for his family. According to this story, al-Hakim was the only son of a devoted and compassionate mother, and there was no one else to take care of her in her time of need. He chose to prioritize his mother's well-being over his pursuit of knowledge, and as a result, he received divine blessings and guidance from the mysterious shaykh. The story highlights the virtuous qualities of al-Hakim at-Termiziy and the significant role his family played in shaping his character and education.

Amir Temur began to serve under Tugluq Temur, but soon, Tugluq Temur appointed his son Ilyas Khoja as the ruler of Movarounnahr, sidelining Amir Temur. In response, Amir Temur allied Balx, Amir Husayn, and other nobles, leading to intense conflict.

The name 'al-Khwarizmi' also gave rise to the term 'algorithm,' which became a fundamental concept in computer science. His work in geography was also noteworthy, as he authored various geographical treatises in Arabic, paving the way for the development of geographical works in both Europe and the Eastern regions. Unfortunately, little information has been preserved about his personal life, but he remains one of the greatest mathematicians in the history of mankKhwarizmi was born in Khwarizm, an ancient region with rich culture and agricultural traditions. His name has been associated with two different origins in historical sources. One source attributes it to his local upbringing among the Zoroastrians (referred to as 'majus' – fire-worshipers in Arabic), indicating that he may have been born into a family with Zoroastrian beliefs or that he himself followed the Zoroastrian religion before converting to Islam. The other origin of his name is linked to his residence in the Dajla area near Baghdad, which was referred to as 'al-Qutrubbul.'</p><p> It was customary for Arabs to give various names or attributions to individuals based on their character traits, skills, favorite habits, or places of residence. Khwarizmi's works suggest that he had a profound knowledge of ancient astronomy, and he was well aware of the celestial secrets. Archaeological excavations in Khwarizm have revealed the existence of ancient observatories, indicating continuous astronomical observations even before the Islamic era. His surviving works indicate that he was well-acquainted with Greek, Indian, and Persian astronomy and mathematics.Al-Ma'mun, the Caliph of the Arab Empire, initially appointed him as an advisor in Marv in 809 AD.</p><p> Later, in 813 AD, he became the caliph himself and moved to Baghdad in 819 AD.During the reign of Al-Ma'mun, when he was in Marv, he attracted Khwarizmi and other prominent scholars from Central Asia and Khurasan to his court. In Baghdad, a group of distinguished scholars emerged from Central Asia and Khurasan, including Khwarizmi, Yahya ibn Abu Mansur from Marv, Al- Farghani, Habash al-Marvazi, Khalid ibn Abdumalik al-Marvarrudiy, Abul Abbas al-Jawhari from Farab, and other scholars.In Baghdad, Al-Ma'mun expanded the activities of the scientific center 'Bayt al-Hikmah,' which was originally established by his father. He transformed it into a major state institution, giving priority to the development of translation activities. Numerous books from Byzantium, India, and other regions were imported, significantly expanding the scope of 'Bayt al-Hikmah.' As a result, two prominent observatories were established: the first one in the Ash-Shammosiya district of Baghdad in 828 AD and the second one near Mount Kasiyun in Damascus in 831 AD. Both observatories were managed by scholars from Central Asia and Khurasan, with Khwarizmi overseeing the activities of 'Bayt al-Hikmah.'Among the leading translators working at 'Bayt al-Hikmah' were Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ibn Matar, Abu Zakariya Yahya ibn al-Bitriq, Hunayn ibn Ishaq, and Kusta ibn Luqo al-Ba'albakki. Ahmad ibn Kasir al- Farghani, a renowned astronomer, also worked there and is noted for his contributions.</p><p> Yahya ibn Abu Mansur from Marv became the director of the observatory in Ash-Shammosiya district and regularly reported to Khwarizmi. After Yahya's death in 831 AD, Khwarizmi took over the leadership of this observatory and actively participated in its activities. Kusta ibn Luqo al-Ba'albakki managed the observatory near Mount Kasiyun, and he also authored his own 'zij.'Ahmad ibn Abdullah al-Marvazi, known as Habash al-Hosib ('the calculator'), another famous astronomer and mathematician from Marv, also collaborated with Khwarizmi in Baghdad. Both of them produced 'zij' tables, which were widely used by astronomers in the Middle Ages. According to researchers, Al-Marvazi introduced trigonometric functions such as tangent and cotangent and included their tables in his work.It should be noted that during Khwarizmi's time in Baghdad and later at the 'Ma'mun Academy,' which was a later name for 'Bayt al-Hikmah,' all the scholars who worked there were referred to as either Central Asian or Khurasanian scholars, and attributing them solely to Khwarizmi would be a mistake. They came from various regions, including Syria, Iraq, Iran, and other parts of the caliphate.</p> However, Central Asian scholars played a prominent role among them. Khwarizmi lived and worked in this scientific environment and passed away in Baghdad in 850More than 20 works have been attributed to Khwarizmi, but only about 10 have survived to this day. These works include 'Al-Jabr wa al-Muqabala,' which is an algebraic treatise; a book on arithmetic titled 'Hind hisabi haqida kitob' or 'Kitob Koshish va ayirish haqida'; a geographical work called 'Kitob surat ul-arz'; 'zij'; 'Asturlab bilan ishlash haqida kitob'; 'Asturlab yasash haqida kitob'; 'Asturlab yordamida azimutni aniqlash haqida'; 'Kitob ar-ruhoma'; 'Kitob at-ta'rix'; and 'Yahudiylarning taqvimi va bayramlarini aniqlash haqida risola.' Four of these works are in Arabic, one is included in Al- Farghani's work, two are preserved in Latin translation, and the remaining three are yet to be found.",

      "The arithmetic treatise of Khwarizmi's time of composition is uncertain, but it is known that he mentioned an algebraic treatise in his work. Thus, it can be inferred that he composed the arithmetic treatise after the algebraic treatise. This arithmetic treatise, known as 'Aljabr va al-muqobala hisobi haqida qisqacha kitob' (a concise book on algebra), began with the phrase 'Diksit Algorizmi,' which means 'Al-Khwarizmi said.' After that, Khwarizmi introduced the nine Indian numerals and explained how any number, including fractions, could be easily written using these numerals. In the Latin translation of the work made in the 12th century in Spain, it starts with the phrase 'Algorismus de numero Indorum,' which means 'Al-Khwarizmi on the Hindu numeral system.' The Latin text lacks many Indian numerals, and the symbols for zero were not used. Instead, the first three numbers, 1, 2, and 3, were used to denote the Hindu numerals. In most cases, the Hindu numerals were later replaced by more widespread Roman numerals in Europe during that time.Khwarizmi explained the positional numeral system with base-10 using the Hindu numerals. He emphasized the convenience of writing numbers in this positional system, especially the significance of zero. He stressed the importance of considering the places, or orders, of numbers and not forgetting to write zero, as otherwise, mistakes would arise in the results.",
