      "Jalaluddin Manguberdi or Jalaluddin Menguberdi (Jalal id-Diniya wa-d-Din Abu-l-Muzaffar Mankburni ibn Muhammad) (1199-1231) — (since 1220) the last Khwarazmshah, Ala id-Din Muhammad II and his Turkoman wife The first son of Aychechaks was named Jalaluddin Mekburni (or Manguberdi), which means 'with a blemish on his face'. The exact date of birth of Jalaluddin is unknown, his official date of birth is 1198. With the help of his great-grandmother, Kipchak queen Turkan Khatun, who was respected in the Gurganj palace, despite existing traditions, Jalaluddin's younger brother O' Zloqkhan sits. Jalaluddin grows up in a military environment and learns martial arts early. Despite the fact that Ghazna (now Afghanistan) is under his care, the father is protected from conspiracies and keeps his son in front of him in Gurganj. Young Jalaluddin tries to get to the border where there are constant battles with the enemies. Knowing about Genghis Khan's planned invasion, Jalaluddin asks his father to send his army to Sirdarya and meet the enemy there, but his father's defensive walls and he is sure that his fortress will not let the enemy into the country, and decides not to raise an army. The Mongols stormed the city. First, in 1220, Bukhara was surrounded, then Samarkand. Muhammad, seriously ill, flees to Caspian. He gathers his three sons, hangs his sword on Jalaluddin's waist, appoints him as the heir to the throne, and urges his other brothers to obey him. After Muhammad's death, Jalaluddin ascended the throne, but the nobles of Gurganj discredited the new ruler and left him out of the people's support. Around Nisa, they meet a Mongol army of seven hundred men and easily defeat them. This small victory incites the people of Khurasan against the Mongol invaders, and as a result, Genghis Khan sends his army to Khorezm and Khurasan and confronts Jalaluddin's younger brothers with his army and brutally defeats them. While Jalaluddin was on his way to his bequeathed land, Marv's viceroy Khan Malik and his army of 40,000 people made an alliance with the Turkoman khan Saif al-Din and his army of 40,000 people. A united army near Kandahar destroys the Mongols, and Jalaluddin reaches Ghazna. He is joined by Khan Malik, the former viceroy of Marv, and Saif id-din, a Turkmen khan, above Murgab. Arriving in Ghazna, Jalaluddin soon gathered an army of ten thousand people, marched against the Mongols who besieged Kandahar, and crushed it. The military commanders of the divided Khorezm armies, hearing about the success of their ruler, began to gather in Ghazna, and soon, under the leadership of Jalaluddin, about 70 thousand soldiers gathered. His uncle Amin al-Mulk, general Timur Malik, Khan of Qarluqs Azam Malik and teacher of Afghans Muzaffar Malik will also come with him. Genghis Khan was still unaware of Khorezmshah's power and sent his 30,000th army under the leadership of Shiki Khutukh against him. The Battle of Parwana In the spring, Jalaluddin's army faced Shiki Khutukh's leading army in the village of Valian on the Gori River. The Mongol army is almost completely destroyed: only a hundred soldiers survive. Then, Jalaluddin went to the gorge and waited for the battle there. Shiki Hutukhu directs his entire army here. The two armies meet in a rocky gorge between imposing cliffs. The place was inconvenient for the cavalry, and both sides had to refrain from moving. Jalaluddin orders Timur Malik to advance with foot archers. Despite the fact that the Khorezms felt the weak side of the yaw, Shiki Hutukhu restrained himself for the first day, then he climbed the rocks and started shooting bows at the Mongols from the hill, causing serious losses to the Mongol army. The next day, Jalaluddin's soldiers looked at the gorge and notices that the number of the Mongol army has increased. In fact, Shiki Hutukhu ordered the reserve horses to pass straw bags wrapped in cloth. The attack on the left flank of the enemy will be covered by a hail of bullets and spears. Then Shiki Hutukhu orders the enemy to launch an attack around him. However, the hail and rocky surroundings hindered the Mongols' success. Jalaluddin saddles his warriors and launches an additional attack. The Mongols began to flee from the attack organized by Koqgis. Khorezmshah's warriors retreat and Shiki Hutukhu loses half of his army. (Afghanistan: the history of warriors from the time of Alexander the Great to the Taliban. — M.: publishing house Eksmo.) Many researchers say that during Genghis Khan's transition to the West, the defeat of Mongolian warriors in Parwana Among their battles in Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan, it was the only major defeat..",

      "Jalaluddin sends a letter to the Kipchak khans with an offer to unite against the Mongol invaders, and in 1220 he receives a reply from his sister, who was captured by Genghis Khan's son Joji and has one child. At school, he persuades Jalaluddin to ally with the Mongols and offers him lands near the Amudarya. But Jalaluddin does not write a reply to this letter. Jalaluddin shows brave resistance against his enemies. In 1230, after the conquest of the Khilot fortress in Iraq, Khorezmshah was defeated in an attack by the alliance of the rulers of Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. The final blow to Jalaluddin's army was delivered by Ugedei army of Mongols led by Charmaghon. Jalaluddin was seriously wounded in the battle, then he tried to hide in the mountains of Kurdistan, where he was killed. The figure of Jalaluddin becomes a legend, the story 'On the Wings of Courage' by the writer Vasiliy Yan and other works are dedicated to him. Jalaluddin Manguberdi is one of the 'national heroes'. In 1999, the 800th anniversary of Jalaluddin's birth was widely celebrated in our country. In Uzbekistan, there are several statues dedicated to him, a memorial complex dedicated to Jaloliddin Manguberdi was built in Khorezm region. In 1999, 25 soum jubilee coins dedicated to the 800th anniversary of Jaloliddin were put into circulation. On August 30, 2000, 'Jaloliddin Manguberdi' order was established. This order is awarded to the command structure that has shown high military skill, heroism and bravery in protecting the country's independence, the borders of the Motherland, the soil of the Motherland and protecting it like the apple of an eye, and made a great contribution to strengthening the defense power of the state. incoming servicemen are rewarded. On August 22, 2003, the Khorezm region was awarded with this order. Jalaluddin was also respected in Turkmenistan, and his bravery against the Mongols is still celebrated today..",

      "Al Hussein Ibn Abdullah ibn Al-Hasan ibn Ali Ibn Sina - a great scientist, physician, musician. He lived in Central Asia and Iran, and was a physician and minister under different rulers. Ibn Sina's treatises are very popular in the East and the West. The 'Laws of Medicine' encyclopedia of theoretical and clinical medicine - a compilation of the views of Greek, Roman, Indian and Central Asian physicians - has served as a necessary guide for several centuries, even in Europe. Main interests - modern medical innovations, homeopathy , folk medicine, studying modern sources and medical abstracts. More than a hundred years after the scientist's death, religious fanatics in Baghdad burned Ibn Sina's philosophical books, and several centuries later, after the invention of a large loom in Europe, the large five volumes of the book 'The Laws of Medicine' were published. This will be the second book published after the Bible. Ibn Sina, the king of medicine, was born in the village of Afshana near Bukhara. In his autobiography, which has survived to our time, he writes, 'My father was from Balkh, and from there he came to Bukhara during the reign of Nuh ibn Mansour from the Samanids, and started his work there in the cabinet. His position was to manage Kharmaysan, the district center near Bukhara. He takes a girl from Afshona in a village near these places, that is, my future mother Sitora - a star, as his wife. First I will be born there, then my brother.' Ibn Sina was a Central Asian who spoke Persian-Dari language. He often wrote quatrains in this language 'to calm the heart'. Ibn Sina's parents liked the name Hussein very much. For this reason, they named their first son Husain, but nobles usually gave honorary names to their sons and daughters-in-law. 'Undoubtedly, my son will have his own son,' Abdullah laughs. So, don't let my son Husain suffer. I have chosen a name for my future grandson - his name will be Ali. His name will be Abu Ali.' Abdullah did not even know that this idea was in vain. Husayn will have neither a son nor a family. He wanders from city to city on caravan routes, passing from one ruler to another, the road becomes his home, and the passengers become his relatives. Little Hussein was a very curious boy. 'What for?' was the most used word in the dictionary. When Husayn was five years old, his family moved to Bukhara. The boy was placed in a Muslim primary school and studied there for ten years. Husain was the youngest among fifteen boys in Khatib Ubaid's class. Students had to read Quranic verses and surahs in Arabic. Most of the young men understood the Arabic language well. As soon as Husain begins to study, he bombards his teacher with questions, but his teacher immediately answers easily: 'Learn the Qur'an. You will find answers to all your questions there.' At the same time, Husayn studied grammar, methodology and Arabic with another teacher. One day, the younger Husayn said: 'I have completely memorized the Qur'an. Can I ask a question now?' His teacher was very offended and said, 'They study the Qur'an for many years, and few Muslims memorize it and call them Hafiz.' 'So I'm Hafiz!' - he quickly replies, boy. In the unfair exam, Husayn recites all the surahs without missing a single word. Ubayd himself memorized the Qur'an. Husain did not go to school after that. At the age of ten, that is, by 990, Husayn completed the initial period of his education. He recites the Qur'an by heart and amazes everyone with his memory, and amazes everyone with his excellent knowledge of Arabic literature. From that time on, Ibn Sina became a shaykh. Here is an excerpt from his personal biography: 'At the age of ten, I memorized the Qur'an and achieved great success in the study of literature, impressing everyone.' The good situation at home created the ground for the spiritual growth of the teenager. Ibn Sina's father was a wealthy and educated person who was close to the Ismaili (former anti-Islam) studies, so he was included in the ranks of his followers. Although Ibn Sina was not from the Ismailis, he was deeply interested in the meaning of their sermons. It is possible that Ibn Sina learned his critical views on the Qur'an from the Ismailis. His first teacher, Abu Abdullah al-Natili, who taught Ibn Sina philosophy and mathematics, was also a follower of these studies. The student surpassed his teacher so much that he began to embarrass the teacher with his questions and answers. In his biography, Ibn Sina expresses the following situation: 'I have analyzed this definition in such a way that I have never heard of it before. He was very surprised and advised my parents not to occupy me with anything but science.",

      "Unfortunately, until the end of Husayn's death, he moved from one city to another during his sojourn, and in the end he could not return to his motherland. He saw the rulers of cities such as Khorezm, Abiverda, Nishapur, Tua, Gurgan, Ray, Hamadan, Isfagan, visited many cities and villages. He suffered many losses in his life, often rose to power and soon fell again, sometimes became a minister, sometimes went to prison, lived both in luxury and in poverty, but his creativity and There was not a day when he did not do his scientific work. 1002 Bukhara was besieged by the Turks and the Samani dynasty was overthrown. There, Ibn Sina was called 'the governor of doctors'. In 1008, the prosperous life of Ibn Sina, who refused to serve Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, turned into misery. He wrote some of his works while on a long journey. He lived in Hamadan from 1015 to 1024 and summarized his scientific activities with his active participation in the political and state affairs of the emirate. Because of the successful treatment of Amir Shams al-Dawla, he is given the position of minister, but he is surrounded by military enemies. Amir refuses the demands of the soldiers to hand over the treasure to Ibn Sina and orders them to release him from his position and expel him from the lands he ruled. Forty days later, the emir's condition worsened again. He found the exiled scientist and ordered him to be appointed minister again. After the death of Amir, he was imprisoned in the fortress for four months for serving the governor of Isfahan. The last ten years of his life were spent in Isfahan (1023-1037) serving in the palace of Amir al-Dawla. They created very favorable conditions for him to create in the palace. He will be the chief physician and adviser to the emir and even accompanied him on his marches. During these years, Ibn Sina was engaged in the teaching of literature and philosophy with his critical approach. At the same time, Sersamara continued his creative work. Many of his manuscripts, including the 'Book of Insaf' ('Kitab ul-Insaf') were burned due to the invasion of Isfahan by the treasury troops. During one of Isfahan's campaigns, Ibn Sina fell ill with a severe stomach ailment and could not cure it. Ibn Sina died in June 1037, telling a stranger his will. In his will, he freed all his slaves and asked them to distribute all his property to the poor. Avicenna was buried under the city wall in Hamadan, eight months later, his ashes were taken to Isfahan and returned to the emir's mausoleum. 'miladi. Ibn Sina was a scientist with a desire to acquire all available knowledge at an encyclopedic level. The philosopher had an extraordinary memory and a sharp mind.",

He is from a privileged class Turkic family. His full name is Abu-Nasr Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Tarkhan Ibn Uzlag al-Farabi al-Turki. Seeking to know the world, al-Farabi left his native land. According to one report, he left when he was a teenager, according to other reports, he was in his forties. Al Farabi visited Baghdad, Khorrun, Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo and other cities of the Arab caliphate. He spent many years of his life in Baghdad, which is considered the political and cultural center of the Arab caliphate. Here he thoroughly enriches his knowledge by studying the works of 'Bayt ul Hikmat' figures, translations of Greek authors, getting acquainted with famous scientists, and when the time comes, he takes a leading place among them with his high morals and thinking. It is here that he was given the status of 'Teacher Assana', that is, the Second Teacher (meaning the second after Aristotle). Indeed, they have many things in common: the breadth and versatility of their scientific interests, the existence and such as striving for a philosophical understanding of the place, getting closer to the 'opinion approved by all', the everyday wisdom of the people. Farabi independently contributed to the science of logic developed by his Greek predecessor. His unique and bold philosophical worldviews were strictly against the opinion of the society, unable to fully accept Greek philosophy and science. His direct criticism of some of the superstitions of the time caused many people to accuse him of heresy and apostasy. In fact, he was completely independent in his thinking, and he remained steadfast in his beliefs. Before Al-Farabi came to Baghdad, he spoke Turkish and other languages, but not Arabic, but towards the end of his life, He knew about seventy languages. While living in Baghdad, al-Farabi began to study various sciences, first of all, logic. At that time, the most famous thinker in Baghdad was Abu Bishr Matt ben Yunis. Al-Farabi was among his students, and according to Abu Bishr Matt, he wrote comments on Aristotle's works on logic. Al-Farabi studied Aristotle's legacy deeply and found relief in accepting the ideas and solving problems left by the great Greek scientist. Al-Farabi's treatise 'On the Classification of Sciences' can be said to be the result of multi-faceted scientific research. In it, all the sciences of his time are listed in a strict order, and the definition of each science is studied. will be However, among fanatical scholars, al-Farabi has a conflict with the opinions of his colleagues. As a result, al-Farabi was forced to leave Baghdad. He went to Egypt via Damascus. In his book 'Civil Politics' he recalls that he started this work in Baghdad and finished it in Cairo (Egypt). After the trip, al-Farabi returned to Damascus and lived there in solitude until the end of his life. He leaves his works on separate papers (for this reason, his works are preserved in separate chapters and notes, some of them are preserved only in fragments, and many of them are not finished).

      "Mirza Muhammad ibn Shahrukh ibn Temur Ulugbek Koraghani (1394-1449) - a great astronomer and mathematician, a famous scholar of his time, a statesman, ruled Movaraunnahr from 1441-1449, the grandson of the famous ruler and entrepreneur Amir Temur. bek (Muhammad Taragai) was born on March 22, 1394 in the city of Sultaniya in the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. In 1405, except for Central Asia, he conquered all the territory of the Near and Middle East, a large land from the Mediterranean Sea to Northern India. after the death of the great owner, who created a huge kingdom, all his inheritance will be passed to his sons and grandsons. Temur's son, Shahrukh, who was elected at the residence of Herat, sits at the top of the Timurid kingdom. The administration of Mavaraunnahr is handed over to Ulugbek, the eldest son of Shahrukh, Amir Temur's grandson. In 1409, Ulugbek was declared the governor of Samarkand, after the death of his father Shahrukh, he became the head of the Timurid dynasty in 1447. In his youth, Ulugbek showed great interest in science and art, especially mathematics and astronomy. . The rich library collected by his father and grandfather became the basis for the expansion of his intellectual outlook, where he spent a lot of time. Ulugbek received a very good education, judging by the standards of those times. Possessing an excellent memory, he was fluent in Arabic and Persian, well versed in Turkish poetry, mastered literary styles and participated in literary debates. He also wrote poems. Ulugbek's teacher was Qazizada Rumi, a well-known scientist, a famous mathematician and astronomer at the court of the Timurids. He showed nine-year-old Ulugbek the ruins of the famous observatory in Maroga. These memories of his youth may have determined the future of the future astronomer. During the reign of Ulugbek, Samarkand became one of the centers of science in the Middle Ages. In Samarkand, in the first half of the 15th century, a whole scientific school was formed around Ulugbek, which united famous astronomers and mathematicians such as Ghiyosiddin Jamshid Koshi, Qazizoda Rumi, Ali Kushchi. At that time, the historian Hafizi Abru, who wrote an excellent work on the history of Central Asia, the famous doctor Mavlano Nefis, the poets Sirojiddin Samarkandi, Sakkoki, Lutfi, Badakhshi and others lived in Samarkand. They were the leading figures of their time who believed in the power of human intelligence and science. 1417-1420 Ulugbek built a madrasa in Samarkand and became the first architectural ensemble to be built in Registan. Ulugbek invited many astronomers and mathematicians of the Islamic world to this madrasa. The other two madrasas were built in Gijduvan and Bukhara. Madrasahs built by Ulugbek served as universities. On the facade of Ulugbek's madrasa built in Bukhara, the inscription 'The pursuit of knowledge is a duty for every Muslim' has been preserved. However, Ulugbek's great passion was astronomy. The meaning of Ulugbek's life and astronomer followers-scientists such as Qazizada Rumi, Jamshid Ghiyosiddin al Koshi, Ali Kushchi motivated the construction of the observatory. According to research scientists, the construction of the observatory was completed in 1428-1429. The observatory was a rare building of its time. In order to withstand earthquakes, the stony foot of Kokhak hill was chosen for the construction of the building. The main instrument - a sextant (angle meter) - is designed along the meridian lines from south to north. In addition to the main instrument, the observatory had other astronomical equipment. Probably, the size of the sextant, its convenient structure, and the knowledge of Ulugbek and his partner were the reasons for making accurate astronomical observations. Under the leadership and participation of the great astronomer Ulugbek, the main work of the observatory 'Zidzhii Koraghani' and 'Ulugbek's star chart' was compiled. In the book, the positions of 1018 stars from this Samarkand observatory are determined with incredible accuracy, the first time since Hipparchus. The creation of the astronomical series is a great contribution to the treasury of world astronomy. In addition, the observatory determines the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator and the length of the sidereal year; work was carried out to calculate the significance of the sine in an angle - an important astronomical constant - up to the eighteenth digit after the comma. Ulugbek checked his data several times and said that his numbers were correct comes to a conclusion. 1437 determines the length of the astronomical year: 365 days 6 hours 10 minutes 8 seconds. Later it became clear that the difference in changes was 58 seconds. If you take into account that the length of an astronomical year is 31 million 558 thousand 150 seconds, you can be sure how accurately Ulugbek made his measurements. Along with being a great scientist, Ulugbek was a weak general. He spent most of his time at the observatory and devoted little time to public affairs. Abdulatif, the eldest son of Ulugbek, under the strong influence of the clergy, declares war against his father. The son invites his father to visit Mecca. 1449 to Mecca",

      "Our compatriot Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur (1483-1530) was a writer, poet, and scientist who occupied a unique place in the culture, literature, and poetry of the Middle Ages, as well as a great statesman and general. Babur founded the Babur dynasty in India with his broad outlook and perfect intelligence, and his name remained in the history of this country as a statesman. His elegant ghazals and rubai's are the rarest masterpieces of Turkish poetry, and his treatises on 'Mubayyin' ('Declared'), 'Hatgi Baburiy', 'Harb ishi', Aruz made a worthy contribution to the fields of Islamic jurisprudence, poetry and linguistic theory. In Babur's march to India, the governors of Punjab, who were dissatisfied with the policies of Ibrahim Sultan, the ruler of Delhi, also supported Babur, and this victory in the battle of Sikri gave Babur the opportunity to firmly establish his rule in India and establish the Babur dynasty. The Babur dynasty ruled India for more than 300 years. Babur did not live long after this victory - he died in December 1530 in the city of Agra, and later, according to his will, his children brought his ashes to Kabul and buried him. What is Babur's service in public affairs? First of all, he personally supported the work of stabilizing the political environment in India, unifying the country's land, beautifying cities, setting trade issues in the right direction, and creating parks. It can be said that the construction of architectural monuments, gardens, libraries, caravanserais, which are still famous, expanded especially during the period of his sons and descendants. The penetration of the Central Asian style into Indian art and architecture began to be felt. In the presence of Babur and his ruling descendants, a perfect spiritual and spiritual environment was formed, which embodied the advanced and intelligent scientists, poets, musicologists and statesmen of that time. Jawaharlal Nehru, a famous figure of the Indian people, wrote about the importance of the cultural environment in the Babur state for India: 'After Babur's arrival in India, there were changes and new incentives gave fresh air to life, art, architecture, and other areas of culture became intertwined.' .Babur continued his literary and artistic activities in India along with a large amount of just government work and created the above-mentioned works. Babur's masterpiece known to the whole world is 'Boburnoma'. It is known that the history of the peoples of Movarunnahr, Khurasan, Iran and India during the period when Babur lived is well covered. The work mainly consists of three parts, the first part of which - the events that happened in Central Asia in the second half of the 15th century; the second part - the events that took place in Kabul, that is, Afghanistan, at the end of the 15th century and the first half of the 16th century; the third part is devoted to the history of the peoples of North India in the first quarter of the 16th century. 'Boburnoma' perfectly describes the political events of that time, the political and economic situation of the Fergana region, its capital Andijan, the major cities of Central Asia: Samarkand, Bukhara, Karshi, Shahrisabz, Osh, Urganch, Oratepa, Termiz and other cities. extremely rare information about In it, we can find information about the major cities of Kabul, Ghazna and many districts, regions, and North India under their control. along with its complexity, the life problems of that time, the full picture of political and social life in Babur's state is revealed.",

      "If we saw a detailed description of the events of the complex period in 'Baburnoma', the inner experiences, emotions and dreams of the king and poet Babur can be seen in his poems. In Babur's poetry, the feeling of Homeland, longing for the Homeland, and the hope of returning to it began to rise. In Babur's lyrics, yor vasli, its beauty, the pain of hijran, the pain of separation, and the joys of separation are beautifully and skillfully expressed. In his lyric poems, the poet always encourages people to goodness, justice, humanity calls to appreciate high human feelings: Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, in addition to his lyrical poems and historical 'Baburnoma', created good works in Islamic jurisprudence and mysticism. In conclusion, the just king and great poet Babur, with his well-known and famous works, is a historian, lyric poet and social as a scientist who contributed to the solution of problems, he left an indelible mark in the history of the spiritual culture of our nation. All students and young people studying at TATU will learn courage, selflessness, patriotism and loyalty to family and descendants from our great compatriot..",

The author of the book 'as Sahih' Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari was born in Bukhara in 810. It is known that his paternal grandfather was one of the first converts to Islam. From the age of 5-6, Ismail began to study the Qur'an and religious sciences, especially hadiths. Possessing a perfect memory, he quickly learned what he read, and then analyzed it in every way. By the age of 16, he knew by heart all the collections of hadith of those times. 825 Al Bukhari his mother and together with his brother Ahmed, they go to Mecca and Medina to perform the Hajj. After performing the pilgrimage, his mother and brother returned to Bukhara, and he traveled to different Muslim countries and studied under the famous teachers of his time.

He started working on his book in Basra and wrote it for many years. According to him, the hadiths of 1080 muhaddiths are included in the book. The reliability of hadiths can be clearly indicated by their source and each chain, since the moral image of the transmitter is implied, which makes it possible to trust him. It is known from sources that he wrote many books, among them There is also the book 'Tarihi Kabir' - 'The Great History'. After writing 'As-Sahih', he returned to Bukhara and taught all those who wanted knowledge, through which he taught people literacy and brought great benefits to society. His reputation was so high that a hadith unknown to him was considered unreliable by the people. Against his will, he had a conflict with the ruler of Bukhara, Tahirid Khalid ibn Ahmad, and was forced to move to the village of Khartang near Samarkand. He died here in 870. His grave, located in the village of Khartang, Chelak District, Samarkand Region, has become the most revered and holy place of worshipers. celebrations were held on the occasion of the 1225th anniversary of the famous scientist's birth. In connection with this event, a project under the leadership of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan I.A. Karimov - a huge rare-architectural complex was erected. The best builders and folk masters of Samarkand, Tashkent, Bukhara, Khiva, Shahrisabz, Andijan, Kokan and Namangan took part in the implementation of the project.

      "Al Beruni is a great scholar of Khorezm, the author of encyclopedic works on history, geography, philology, astronomy, mathematics, geodesy, mineralogy, pharmacology, geology and many other subjects. Beruni was the first in the Middle East to say that the Earth can revolve around the Sun and determined the size of the Earth's circumference. American historian Dj. Sarton said about the great scientist: 'Astronomy and mathematics, astrology and geography, anthropology and ethnography, archeology and philosophy, botany and mineralogy would have been impoverished without his great name.' His full name is Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni. He was born on September 4, 973 in Kot, the ancient capital of Khorezm. Little is known about Beruni's early life, only that he was an orphan. Because of his big nose, he was called 'Nosy'. However, under his unsightly exterior, a shrewd mind is hidden, and his vizier and cousin, Khorezmshah of Iraq, falls under the eye. In his old age, Beruni wrote: '... the Iraqi family gave me bread and tea and took me among the people...' He had excellent mathematical and philosophical knowledge. Beruni's first teacher was Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Iraq al-Jadi, the author of basic works on astronomy, mathematics and trigonometry. According to Beruni, everything in nature changes based on the laws of nature, and these laws can only be understood with the help of science. His main works were devoted to mathematics and astronomy, which were of great practical importance in Khorezm's economic life - land irrigation and trade trips. has been It was important to be able to determine the exact positions of the Sun and the Moon in the sky, and to measure astronomical constants such as the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, the length of the solar and sidereal years, and others. This, in turn, required the development of mathematical science, in particular, flat and spherical trigonometry on the one hand, and nerves on the other to more accurately define it. Beruni's achievements in these areas served as an unparalleled achievement for several centuries. Beruni determined the radius of the Earth almost exactly based on its circular shape (more than 6000 km). Beruni accepted the progressive ideas of ancient Greek and ancient Indian philosophers on the basis of some astronomical problems and improved them: he approved the same fiery nature of the Sun and stars, unlike the dark bodies, that is, the planets; determined the movement of the stars and determined their gigantic size in relation to the Earth; He studied the gravity of the earth. Beruni confirmed that the Sun does not revolve around the Earth, but the Earth revolves around it, putting an end to all doubts about Ptolemy's approval of the geocentric world system. He explained that sunrise and sunset are caused by the emission of dust particles from the rays of the sun hidden behind the horizon. 'Smoke-like' nature said about the bright freshness that appears around (Sun's crown) during a solar eclipse. Beruni developed astronomical methods of geodetic measurements. 600 years before V. Snellius, he proposed the method of trigonometric measurement of distance. He perfected the main astronomical instruments used in those times (astrolabe, quadrant, sextant). For 400 years, he invented the world's largest estimated radius of 7.5 meters, the first fixed quadrant for observing the Sun and planets. The accuracy of his measurements of the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator was unmatched for many centuries.",
    text2:
      "In his first work 'Chronology of Ancient Nations' (1000 years), Beruni described the systems of chronicles of all nations known at that time. Astronomical researches and other scientific works done by him are written in the 'Book of Basic Beginnings of Astronomy'. He lived in the palaces of local governors in the cities of Kot and Kurgan, and later in the palace of King Mamun in Khorezm. He led an academy of famous scientists. Ibn Sina and al-Khwarazmi were the founders of algebra. Correspondence with Ibn Sina has been preserved. In it, opinions were exchanged about Aristotle's book. Starting from 1017, when Khorezm was conquered by Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznavi, Sultan Mahmud and his successors lived in the palace of Masud and the Maduds in Ghazna, participating in Mahmud's trips to India. he lives here for several years. The 'Treasury' stage was the most productive stage in Al Beruni's work. His trips to India during these years were included in his main work, 'The Book of Determining the Reasonable and Inconceivable Doctrines of the Hindus' ('India' was completed in 1030). After the death of Sultan Mahmud, his son Masud takes the throne. He was very kind to Beruni. Beruni says about Mas'ud: 'He created conditions for me to engage in all my creativity, he took me under his guidance...'. Beruni's scientific legacy includes 150 works on mathematics, astronomy, geography, mineralogy, history, ethnography, philology and philosophy. As a scientist investigating natural phenomena, he contributed to the expansion of the concept of numbers, the theory of cubic equations, spherical trigonometry, and compiled a trigonometric table. He knew Arabic, Persian, Greek, Syriac and Sanskrit languages and developed the rules of natural-scientific terminologies for translating from one language to another. - described his philosophical systems. Al-Biruni used the comparative method in his work: 'I am quoting the theory of existence of the Indians, and at the same time I am quoting the theory of the Greeks in order to shed light on the interdependence of these two peoples,' he writes. At the same time, he also mentioned Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Galen and other Greek scholars, compared Hindu and Islamic ideas, especially Sufism, and said that it was very close to Hindu theories of Sankhi and Yoga. Comparing the traditions of different peoples, he mentioned the lifestyle traditions of Slavs, Tibetans, Khazars, Turks and other peoples..",

He was brought up and studied in Bukhara by a man named Arslanbob and like most students of science. There, he learned leech manners from the famous Yusuf Hamadani, then returned to Turkestan and founded his sect. He used his poems to promote the ideas of Sufism, as well as the foundations of his sect. The moral, philosophical and theological foundations of Yassavi's wisdom are formed directly on the basis of the ideas of the Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad. In the wisdom of Ahmad Yassavi, the spiritual and moral qualities glorified in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, are promoted - kindness, generosity, contentment and honesty. takes place. In all of them, the virtues of the Sufi order are to know the truth. The ideas that call for love of the truth and withdrawal from the world of lust have found their reflection. One of the main ways to create a perfect person is to give up the pleasures of mysticism. Lust causes greed, theft, ignorance, and selfishness. That is why satisfaction is the life motto of Ahmed Yassavi. By self-satisfaction, thanksgiving, and eating a halal bite, a person can 'see' the Truth, and those who are self-centered will not turn back from selfishness, they will suffer from the scourge of lust. In particular: Ahmad Yassavi, because of ignorance, illiteracy, lack of religion, disrespect for parents and teachers, spiritual poverty, evil, arrogance, ignorance is the most basic person in life, in a country where there is no enlightenment. noting that the country is facing a crisis, Ahmad Yassavi, while promoting the path to the truth in his wisdom, emphasizes the need to free people from the mire of ignorance. He demands to be 'knowledgeable in Shariat, to be knowledgeable in Tariqat, to be perfect in truth, to be a river of knowledge in enlightenment'. ideas encourage a person to give up bad vices, the scourge of lust.

Ahmad Yassavi spent the rest of his life in the basement after reaching the age of 63, that is, after reaching the age of the prophet. At the same time, he is the founder of the Yassaviya sect. They tried to justify the effectiveness of various ways to ensure human perfection. At the same time, the researchers testify that according to the ideas of the Yassawiya doctrine, there is opposition to the tyrannical ruler, impure religious leaders, ignorant and ignorant people. By the beginning of the 14th century, another stream of Sufism, the Naqshbandi sect, was formed in Movarounnahr. The doctrine of Naqshbandiyya is fundamentally different from other sects with its life ideas. The 'root' of the Naqshbandi sect goes back to ancient times, that is, to the Eastern Renaissance. He points out that two great scholars in Central Asia - Abulqasim Ali al-Khoraqani (died in 1034 at the age of 80) and Abu Ali al-Farmadi (died in 1084) had a great contribution to the development of Sufi teachings. The famous philosophers of Sufism Ahmad al-Ghazali and Yusuf Hamadani (1049-1140 years) are students of Abu Ali al-Farmadi. Khwaja Hasan Andoqi, Khwaja Abdullah Barraqi (Barkiy), Khwaja Ahmad Yassavi and Khwaja Abdulhaliq Ghijduvani are scholars of Sufism.

The names of such works as 'Khatm ul-Avliya' ('The Last of the Saints') and 'Nazair ul-Qur'an' ('Lessons of the Qur'an') are given in this way, as well as in the introductory parts. Regarding the date of birth of Al-Hakim at-Tirmizi, different years are given in written sources and literature. Usually, in the written sources of the Middle Ages, in most cases, only the year of the author's death is indicated, and the date of birth is not given. For example, the famous scientist Haji Khalifa in several places of his famous work 'Kashf uz-Zunun' indicated the death of al-Hakim al-Tirmizi as the year 255 AH (melodic 869). In addition, some information about his life is given in the inscriptions on the tombstone of the Alloma located near the city of Termiz, and the date of his death is written as 255 Hijri (melody 869). Some other sources also mention that he died on this date. If we take into account that Al-Hakim al-Tirmizi lived for a long time - 116 or 120 years, it becomes clear that the scholar was born in the middle of the eighth century (approximately between 750-760). At the same time, some modern researchers indicated completely different dates of his birth and death. For example, the famous Egyptian scientist Abdulfattah Abdullah Baraka al-Hakim al-Tirmizi, who deeply studied the life and teachings of al-Hakim al-Tirmizi, was born in the city of Termiz in 205 AH (melody 820), lived a long life, and died in 320 AH. (melody 932) writes that he died at the age of 112[3]. In conclusion, we can say that in-depth scientific research in this direction will allow us to determine the dates of birth and death of Allama al-Hakim al-Tirmizi. His mausoleum is located near the city of Termiz on the banks of the Amudarya. Valuable information about the city of Termiz was provided by Arab geographers al-Muqaddasi (Ahsan ut-taqasim fi marifat al-aqoliym), al-Istakhri (al-Masolik wal-mamolik), al We find it in the works of Balazuriy-Futuh ul-buldan and other authors. According to these sources, the city of Termiz, where al-Hakim at-Tirmizi was born, was also famous as one of the largest and most prosperous cities of Movarounnahr in the 9th century. Islamic science and culture are highly developed in the city. Many scholars in various fields of science, including Islamic sciences, who grew up in the city of Termiz, are famous all over the world with the at-Tirmizi nisab. Al-Hakim al-Tirmizi is one of the great figures of Termizism who has received worldwide respect. Unfortunately, we did not find any specific information about al-Hakim al-Tirmizi's childhood and youth in the sources. According to some reports about his parents, his father Ali ibn al-Hasan was famous in his time as one of the prominent scholars of hadith science. According to the Arab historian al-Khatib al-Baghdadi in his famous work 'Tarihi Baghdad' ('History of Baghdad'), he was in the city of Baghdad, which is one of the largest centers of the Muslim world. participated in heated debates and discussions with the famous scientists and scholars of the time on various issues of hadith science. Al-Hakim al-Tirmizi wrote in his autobiographical treatise 'Bad'u sha'ni Abu Abdullah' and 'Ar-Radd al'al-muattila' that his mother and grandfather were among the most advanced scholars of hadith in their time. was. From this information, it can be concluded that Al-Hakim at-Tirmizi was born in an intellectual family, where knowledge was highly valued, and he grew up in this scientific and spiritual environment. Ultimately, under the influence of these factors, his spiritual world and scientific thinking were formed and matured. At the same time, it should be emphasized that the services of his father Ali ibn al-Hasan in al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's scientific development are extremely important. For example, he was not only a loving and caring father for his child, but also a demanding coach and an enlightened teacher. In this regard, al-Hakim al-Tirmizi tells the following story in one of his books: I was eight years old when Allah, the Exalted, separated me from my teacher - my father.

Sarkarda was the founder of the Timurid kingdom (1370), the capital of which was Samarkand. Amir Temur was born on April 9, 1336 in the village of Khoja Ilgor (Yakkabog) near Kesh (Shahrisabz). According to legends, he was born with a red blood clot in his hand, and his hair was as white as moisafid, such a condition was also mentioned about Genghis Khan. His father, Amir Muhammad Taraghai, was one of the barlos of the Turkish generation, and he was one of the influential intellectuals in Movarounnahr. His ancestor was descended from the legendary Turkish Alan Kuva family, and was one of the most respected people in the palace of the Chigatoi clan. The lands around Kesh and Nefes were considered their property. Temur's father, Taragai, regularly participated in the congresses of Chigatai begs, who were called to the shores of the Il river, which is the khan's ulus. In 1355, he married the daughter of Amir Jaku, the barolo of Turmush Agha. The chief amir of Movarunnahr, Kazaghan Amir, convinced of Temur's abilities, gave him his grandson Uljay Turkan in marriage in the same year. With the honor of this marriage, the union of Amir Husayn, the grandson of Qazaghan, and Amir Temur was born. This alliance will be very useful in the fight against the Mongols. In 1356, 2 sons of Amir Temur were born - Jahangir and Omar Shaykh. From the beginning of the 13th century to the end of the 14th century, the economic situation of Movaraunnahr worsened day by day. Khan of Mongolia Tughluq Temur took advantage of this and reached Kashkadarya without any resistance. Amir Temur begins to serve him. However, Tughluq Temur appoints his son Ilyas Khodja as the ruler of Movaraunnahr, and Amir Temur refuses to serve the prince, unites with the ruler of Balkh, Amir Husayn, and enters into a decisive battle with the Mongols. At this time, warlords - 'hangmen' and fighters against the Mongols ruled in Samarkand. The slogan of this people's movement 'Either struggle for freedom, or hanged head' was created by its participants. In 1370, Amir Temur was declared the chief amir of Turan at the congress held in Balkh. Chingiz's daughter Sarai Mulk Khanim's marriage gave Amir Temur the honorary title of 'gurgan', i.e. 'son-in-law of the khan'. The main task of Amir Temur was to endure the fragmented state and unite separate lands into one state. He appointed Samarkand as the capital of this state and quickly began to build the city's protective walls, fortresses and palaces. Amir Temur subjugates and unites the lands between the Amudarya and Syrdarya, as well as Fergana and Shosh regions, and then begins his invasion campaigns. Amir Temur's rule lasted 35 years (1370 - 1405). He created a great kingdom from the Indus and the Ganges to the Syrdarya and Zarafshon, from the Tien Shan to the Bosphorus. He spent most of his life in marches. Amir Temur died in the city of Otrar in 1405 during his march to China.",

      "During the lifetime of Amir Temur, a special work called 'Temur Tuziklari' was written, which talks about state management. The work consists of two parts and is an invaluable historical source of the Middle Ages. It describes Temur's biography related to his life events, views of the famous statesman and general on military art, state structure and administration. The centralized, strongly governed state created by Amir Temur was built on the basis of this invaluable set of rules. Having created a large state, Amir Temur prepared the conditions for the country's economic and cultural development. The ancient traditions of the past are revived in a new historical form. As Movaraunnahr became a trade, economic and cultural center throughout the Near and Middle East, Samarkand, Kesh, Bukhara, Termiz, Tashkent, Marv and other ancient cities began to beautify. Large buildings of mosques, madrasas, mausoleums, caravanserais and baths began to be built. It has become a common practice to immortalize any victory in architecture. In his construction activities, Amir Temur followed certain political goals - the buildings he built should have been able to demonstrate the power of the kingdom. During the years of his rule, Amir Temur ended the feudal disunity, established trade and diplomatic relations with major European kingdoms such as France, England, and Castile. Unfortunately, after the death of Amir Temur, trade and diplomatic relations with Western Europe ended. Amir Temur stands in the pages of history along with great generals such as Alexander the Great, Darius Pervius, and Julius Caesar. Amir Temur is one of the most determined people in the history of mankind. Based on various sources, in our knowledge of him, he is embodied as a ruler, an officer, a general, and a warrior.",

      "The great mathematician, astronomer and geographer Muhammad al-Khorazmi lived and worked at the end of the 8th century and the first half of the 9th century. During this period, Central Asia was part of the Arab caliphate. The socio-economic requirements of the developing system became one of the main factors of the development process in this period. It was necessary to develop sciences such as astronomy, geodesy, and geometry in order to further develop construction, trade, crafts, agriculture, and other fields. The advanced scientists of that time had a clear idea about the practical importance of these sciences, and Muhammad al-Khorazmi was the leader and leader of these scientists. Khorazmi made a great contribution to world science. He became the founder of algebra. The word 'algebra' itself is taken from his treatise 'Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fi lisab al-jabr wa al-muqabala'. His treatise on arithmetic, based on Indian numerals, led to the spread of the decimal positional counting system we use today and operations in this system in Europe. And the name of the scientist 'al-Khorazmi' in the form of 'algorithm' has been fixed forever in science. His work on geography laid the foundation for the creation of dozens of geographical works in Arabic. Khorezmi's work 'Zij' showed the way of development of astronomy both in Europe and in Eastern countries. But unfortunately, there is almost no information about the life of such a figure who founded several branches of science, 'the greatest mathematician of his time and, if all conditions are taken into account, one of the greatest of all times' (J. Sarton) not preserved. Khorazmi was born and grew up in the land of Khorezm. In the literature, 783 is accepted as the year of his birth. It can be said that he received his initial education and knowledge in various fields mainly from many teachers in his country, in the cities of Central Asia. In the sources, it is said that the names al-Majusi and al-Qutrubbuli are added to Khorezmi's name. The first of these is that the scientist originally came from the local population of Khorezm, that is, from a family of fire worshipers (Arabic - 'majus' means fire worshiper), but also from a family of priests of the religion of fire worshipers, while the scientist himself or his father was a pagan, who later converted to Islam. shows that he did. In Khorezm, pagans kept their religious traditions for a long time even after Islam. Beruni testifies about this in his work 'Osori Bakiya'. The second of the mentioned names indicates that Khorezmi spent the years of his Moysafid life in al-Qutrubbul daha on the banks of the Tigris near Baghdad. Usually, Arabs give a person several different names, 'nisbas', depending on his characteristics, professions, favorite habits or places of residence. This is how the name al-Qutrubbuli of Khwarazmi came about. Khwarazm had a very ancient culture, and its agriculture was based on irrigated agriculture, which in turn required the existence of advanced calculation methods of astronomy and chronology. it was enough. In fact, astronomy was very developed in ancient Khorezm, the Khorezms knew the 'secrets' of the sky much better than the Arabs. Archaeological excavations testify that there were observatories in Khorezm several centuries before Islam, and constant astronomical observations were made there. The analysis of Khorezmi's works that have come down to us shows that he knew Greek, Indian and Iranian astronomy and mathematics well. He became the caliph and moved to Baghdad in 819. When al-Ma'mun was in Marw, he attracted Khorazmi, other scholars from Mowarounahr and Khorasan to his court. During the time of Caliph al-Ma'mun, a group of great scholars from Central Asia and Khorasan created in Baghdad. Among them, along with Khorezmi, there were Yahya ibn Abu Mansur from Marv, al-Farghani, Habash al-Marwazi, Khalid ibn Abdumalik al-Marwar Rudi, Abul Abbas al-Jawhari from Farob and other scholars. In Baghdad, al-Ma' The scientific center 'Bayt-ul-Hikma', founded by his father, improved its activities in every way, gave it the appearance of a large state institution, and at first developed translation activities on a large scale. Many books were brought from Byzantium and India, and the scope of 'Bayt ul-Hikma' was somewhat expanded. Two large observatories were built under it: the first one was built in 828 in the al-Shammosiya neighborhood of Baghdad, and the second one was built in 831 on Mount Kasiyun near Damascus. will be done. Both observatories are managed by scientists from Central Asia and Khorasan. As the director of this scientific center, Khorezmi monitors its activities. Among the major translators who worked in 'Bait ul-Hikma' during the time of Khorezmi were Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ibn Matar, Abu Zakariyya Yuhanno ibn al-Bitriq, Hunayn ibn Ishaq and Kusto ibn Luqa al-Ba. There were al-Bakkis",

      "Ahmad ibn Abdullah al-Marwazi, a famous Marwian astronomer and mathematician known by the nickname Habash al-Hasib ('The Abyssinian Accountant'), also worked in Baghdad in collaboration with Khorezmi. He created two zij, which were widely used by medieval astronomers. According to the researchers, he introduced the tangent, cotangent, cosecant functions and gave their tables. It is a mistake to call all the scholars who worked with Khorazmi in Baghdad, later known as 'Ma'mun Academy' Bait ul-Hikma, Central Asian or Khurasan. it would be. Scholars from Syria, Iraq, Iran and other parts of the Caliphate also worked there. However, Central Asians occupy a significant place among them. Khorezmi lived and created in such a scientific environment and died in Baghdad in 850. Only 10 of the more than 20 works written by Khorezmi have reached us. These are 'A Brief Book on Algebra and Al-Muqabala Calculus' an algebraic work, 'A Book on Indian Arithmetic' or 'A Book on Addition and Subtraction' an arithmetical work, and 'Kitab surat ul-arz' a work on geography. 'Zij', 'Book about working with Asturlob', 'Book about making Asturlob', 'About determining azimuth using Asturlob', 'Kitab ar-ruhoma', 'Kitab at-tarikh', 'About determining the Jewish calendar and holidays pamphlet'. Four of these works are in Arabic, one is part of Farghani's work, two are preserved in Latin translation, and the remaining three have not yet been found. It is not known when Khwarizmi's arithmetical treatise was written. However, the scientist remembers his algebraic treatise. So, it is clear from this that Khorezmi wrote the arithmetic treatise after the algebraic treatise. This treatise was translated into Latin in Spain in the twelfth century. The only manuscript of the translation copied in the 14th century is kept in the Cambridge University Library. The treatise begins with the phrase 'Dixit Algorizmi', that is, 'Al-Khwarizmi said.' After that, Khorezmi talks about the advantages of nine Indian numerals in representing numbers and how any number can be written briefly and easily with them. In the Latin manuscript of the work, Indian numerals are often not written, their place is left empty, or sometimes Indian numerals corresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5 are written. Indian numerals were often replaced by Roman numerals, which were widely used in Europe at that time. He especially emphasizes the importance of the convenience of writing numbers in this way, especially the use of zero. Then Khorezmi goes on to describe arithmetic operations. In this, Khorezmi teaches to pay attention to the degrees of numbers and not to forget to write zero, otherwise the result will be wrong, he says.",
