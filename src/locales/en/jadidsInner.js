      "<p>Abdulla Qodiriy was a talented and widely known poet, writer, playwright, and publicist in Uzbek literature, credited as the founder of the novel genre. His works were dedicated to Uzbek people's lives. A play written in the late 20th century but based on Qodiriy's life and works, titled 'Oppoq qora laylak,' was staged at the Ilhom Theatre in Tashkent by the director Mark VaAbdulla Qodiriy (also known as Julqunboy) was born in 1894 in Tashkent to a non-noble merchant family. His childhood and early years were surrounded by artisans, farmers, and landless peasants, as well as talented artists and struggling craftsmen who spent their days in constant need. This world of hardworking people, as well as the city's vagabonds, played a significant role in shaping Qodiriy's creative character. He lived a long life, surpassing his father's age by 102 years, and inherited the sensitivity of an observer from his father. His father had a great eye for detail, and perhaps this is why Qodiriy often referred to himself as his father's son.</p><p>Qodiriy received his early education in a Muslim school (1904-1906) and later attended a Russian-Tatar school (1908-1012), completing it successfully. In 1912, his first literary experiments began. His initial published works, 'Xotinboz' (1915) and 'Baxtsiz kuyov' (1915), revealed the vivid and vibrant aspects of Uzbek customs and traditions. During 1915- 1917, Qodiriy studied Arabic and Persian languages at the Abdul Qosim Madrasa. The influence of Jadidism is noticeable in his early works.During the Soviet era, A. Qodiriy attended the literary courses in Moscow named after V. Ya. Bryusov (1924-1925). Later, from 1925 to 1926, he worked at the 'Mushtum' Uzbek literary journal in Tashkent. There, the prolific writer's fictional stories and columns were published to great acclaim.</p> Qodiriy's novels and stories, such as 'O'tgan kunlar' and 'Mehrobdan chayon,' as well as his collective works like the story 'Obid Ketmon,' were dedicated to the life of Uzbek people in 19th-century Tashkent and Kokand. The novel 'O'tgan kunlar' gained immense popularity and was highly sought after by readers. Even illiterate people formed reading groups to listen to it. Many Uzbek families named their children after the characters Otabek and Kumush from this novel.Abdulla Qodiriy faced repression during his life. On December 31, 1937, he was arrested as an 'enemy of the people,' with envious 'comrades in pen' orchestrating his downfall. On October 4, 1938, he was sentenced to death and executed. He was buried at the Kamolon Cemetery (Xo'ja Alambardor) in Tashkent. After Qodiriy's death, those who once scorned his novel 'O'tgan kunlar' began to regret it. The situation changed over time. In 1957, Abdulla Qodiriy was posthumously exonerated. However, information about his arrest and execution remained hidden for many years. Thus, in 1958, when the Russian translation of the novel 'O'tgan kunlar' was published, it was devoid of any information related to Abdulla Qodiriy's death. The translator, the famous writer Izzat Sultonov, provided only a brief note stating, 'Abdulla Qodiriy passed away in 1939.'An unpublished play based on Abdulla Qodiriy's life and works, written in the late 20th century, was staged as 'Oppoq laylak' at the Ilhom Theatre in Tashkent under the direction of Mark Vayl.Currently, the name of the writer associated with the central streets of Tashkent, the cultural hub near Chorsu, and the Yunusobod metro station is Abdulla Qodiriy. He was not only familiar with the life of his people through books but also engaged in direct conversations with ordinary people, appreciating their unique qualities. He completed his education at the traditional school and then continued his studies in Russian-Tatar schools and madrasas. He took a keen interest in the works of prominent Uzbek literary figures like Navoi, Lutfiy, Muqimiy, Furqat, Cho'lpon, Fitrat, and other Abdulla Qodiriy's literary journey evolved over two centuries, embracing different facets - complete, contrasting, social, political, and ethical struggles of the time. Undoubtedly, these periods left visible marks in his works, reflecting the contrasting, societal, and cultural complexities of his time.In general, Abdulla Qodiriy's literary legacy is defined by continuous developments and remarkable creative achievements. His historical novels 'O'tgan kunlar' (1926) and 'Mehrobdan chayon' (1929) mark the first works on historical subjects in Uzbek literature.",
    text2:
      "The fascination with historical themes in Abdulla Qodiriy's works originates from his deep understanding of his people's past, demonstrated through the resilience, hard work, and heroism of his people's struggle for freedom and independence. The 1961 Russian edition of the novel 'Mehrobdan chayon' stands out for its unique quality of vividly and truthfully portraying Uzbek life and history, capturing the colors of the era during the 184In this news, Abdulla Qodiriy's prowess in crafting Uzbek historical novels is evident. In his novel 'Mehrobdan chayon,' the author skillfully weaves together traditions, providing subtle insights into the characters' psychological nuances and pioneering new ways to depict their inner world while showcasing the transformation of the characters' actions and behaviors.The novel 'Mehrobdan chayon' serves as a profound representation of the social and ethical life of Turkestan during the late 19th century.",

      "In 1901, a new-style school was established in Rajabamin, near the city of Samarkand. In this innovative school, subjects like arithmetic and natural sciences were taught. Shakuriy himself opened this new- style school, where he paid serious attention to teaching the rules of the Arabic language and reading, acquainting students with words through syllables, which helped them easily understand simple words for children. On the first day of learning, Shakuriy would write syllables in a notebook and teach the students to read and write them. Then, he would replace the syllables with letters and create new syllables from these letters. This way, children would learn to read and write within five to six months. Later, Shakuriy's 'Rahnamoi savod' ('Guide to Principles') and the textbook 'Alifbe ta’limi' (Learning the Alphabet), written in the sound-letter method, were used for teaching.In 1907, Shakuriy wrote his second book called 'Jameul-hikoyat' (Collection of Stories) for the purpose of providing initial knowledge on ethics, manners, and social rules suitable for children's characteristics. This book was intended for the second and third grades of the initial school. It consisted of 48 small moral stories and 15 poetic pieces. The third reading book was titled 'Zub-datul ash’or.' The main goal of the author in creating this reading book was to consolidate and strengthen the knowledge acquired by students, as well as to familiarize them with poetry and examples from the classical literature of Uzbek, Tajik, and Azerbaijani languages.Shakuriy conducted a general examination for his students once a year. During the examination, parents, proponents, as well as opponents of the new-style school, such as mullahs and nobles, observed the results of the students' six-month progress in subjects like arithmetic, geography, and natural sciences. People were amazed to witness the achievements of the children within such a short period, and many became supporters of the school. Shakuriy himself wrote about this: 'One day, I invited scholars and the rich to the examination held for my students who had studied for six months. They conducted the examination based on the knowledge acquired during the six-month period. People were surprised to see the effectiveness of this teaching method, and they praised me.Furthermore, Shakuriy's new teaching method attracted the attention of prominent Jadid intellectuals like Hamza Hakimzoda Niyozi, Sadriddin Ayni, Mirzo Abdulvohid Munzi, and others. In 1909, Hamza came to Samarqand to visit Shakuriy's school and witness the results of his examinations, which left a great impression on him.",
    text2:
      "The significance of Shakuriy's innovative teaching method lies in the fact that, first of all, he rejected all old teaching methods and textbooks and, in the beginning, used the syllable method and later employed the sound-letter method to make teaching more accessible. As a result of this teaching method, students quickly acquired knowledge within six months. Secondly, he introduced the method of teaching boys and girls together in the school. Thirdly, he insisted on teaching children in their native language at first and then encouraged them to learn Uzbek, Tajik, Arabic, and Russian languages fluently. Fourthly, Shakuriy authored easy-to-understand and informative textbooks, which he then published. And fifthly, he introduced manual labor and music lessons in Samarqand schools. Besides introducing his students to agricultural and handicraft work, he allocated special hours in the school schedule for such activities.",

He was born in 1886 into a distinguished family in Bukhara, where he studied at the madrasas and dorulfununs (educational institutions). Due to his proficiency in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages, he had a profound appreciation for the works of the great scholars of the East. His father was a merchant, and until 1918, Fitrat engaged in commerce in Kashgar. He received his early education under the guidance of his mother, Mustafo Bibi (Bibijon), from whom he first learned about renowned poets like Navoi, Uvaysi, Zebunniso, Bedil, and FuzuIn 1909, Fitrat went to study in Turkey and continued his education at the Istanbul dorulfunun until 1913. He actively participated in the 'Bukhara Ta'limi Maorifi' association established in Turkey. He contributed to the completion of Jadid-style schools initiated by Behbudiy and became a prominent figure in the field of education. His first collection, 'Sayha' (Chorlov), was published in 1911. During these years, works like 'Sayyohi hindi' and 'Munozara' were also published. While studying in Turkey from 1909 to 1913, he impressed his professors and teachers with his intelligence and erudition. Fitrat was given the title of 'Fitrat-Donishmand' (Fitrat, the Learned). His works flourished during revolutionary times in Turkistan and were in harmony with the 'Sharq uyg'ongan' (Awakening of the East) period. Like his predecessors, he also pursued lofty goals for enlightenment. His work 'Munozara,' written in the Tajik language in 1913, shows his desire to liberate his people from oppression and pursue the path of salvation.During this period, promoting the Russian language and Russian culture was also a significant aspect of Fitrat's enlightening efforts. These views were widely spread through his self-established and edited newspaper 'Hurriyat.' In this same period, he wrote the poem 'Hayot yo'lida birinchi masala - mamasalasidir' (The First Problem on the Path of Life is the School Issue), published in the 'Hurriyat' in 1917.

His plays 'Qon,' 'Begijon,' 'Chin sevish,' 'To'lqin,' 'Vose' qo'zg'oloni,' and 'Ro'zalar' were also created during this period.In 1922, when his collection 'O'zbek shoirlari' (Uzbek Poets) was published, the poems 'Kecha,' 'Behbudiy mozorini izlab,' and 'Sharq' demonstrated his poetic evolution. In the poem 'Shoir' (The Poet), the line 'I have set many hopes for myself' can be seen as a conclusion. In his poem 'Kim deyay seni' (Who can call you?), written in 1920, the intense longing, anticipation, and submission of the lover to his beloved are expressed in a lyrical tone, indicative of the new phase of his creativity. His poetry exhibits enthusiasm for innovation, novelty, and beauty in the world. This sentiment can also be felt in his plays 'Abulfayzxon,' 'Arslon,' and 'Vose'' (in Tajik). His literary works 'Qiyomat' (Resurrection), 'Shaytonning tangriga isyoni' (Rebellion against Satan's Trap) express deep thoughts and address major social issues.Fitrat was not only a prominent scholar but also actively engaged in various aspects of education and cultural development.

He was born in 1878 in Gijduvan district, Buxoro region, and received his early education from a local mosque school. Later, he continued his studies under the guidance of Sayid Akbar in Buxoro. Ayni had a keen interest in literature and art, and his poems started to gain recognition around 19Due to his close association with the Jadid movement, he faced scrutiny in 1915 and found work at a cotton mill. However, when the Jadid uprising began in Buxoro in 1917, Ayni actively supported the revolution through his poetry. In 1920, he moved to Samarqand with his family and engaged in teaching and literary activities. During the Soviet era, he remained dedicated to literary work. He compiled the first Tajik national literary anthology titled 'Tojik adabiyoti namunalari' (Exemplary Tajik Literature). Ayni served as a member of the Central Election Commission of the Tajik SSR in 1929 and became a member of the Writers' Union of the USSR in 1934.He was an expert in philology, and his significant contributions to literary studies included research on Uzbek and Tajik classical poets. Ayni was well-versed in both Uzbek and Tajik languages and wrote some of his works in both languages, enriching the literary traditions of both nations. Among his major works are 'Odina' (1924), 'Doxunda' (1930), 'Qullar' (1934), 'Sudxo'rning o'limi' (1939), and 'Xotiralar' ('Bukhara') (1949-1954). Ayni's novel 'Qullar' stands out as the first Tajik novel of the 20th century, depicting the life and struggles of a Tajik revolutionary during the 19th and 20th centuries. His literary works received recognition beyond Central Asia, and his writings were translated into multiple languages, including Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, French, and Urdu. Sadriddin Ayni's contribution to the literary and historical heritage of Central Asia remains highly valued, and he is regarded as an eminent author in the region.The novel 'Doxunda' by Sadriddin Ayni demonstrates the author's development towards socialist realism. While 'Odin' had a passive protagonist, 'Doxunda' features an active participant in the revolution. 'Qullar' is the first Tajik novel of the 1930s and 1940s, portraying the period of Central Asia. In 'Sudxo'rning o'limi,' the character Kori Ishkamb embodies a two-faced and greedy personality, resembling Plyushkin, Yudushka Golovlev, and Gobsek, while also reflecting the national character of the Tajik people.

      "At the beginning of the last century, among the enthusiastic educators and intellectuals who struggled for the freedom of the homeland, the enlightenment of the people, and the progress of the nation, there was also Hoji Muin Shukrulloev. Hoji Muin was born on March 19, 1883, in Samarqand. His father, Shukrullo, was a merchant and passed away at the age of 32. At the age of twelve, Hoji Muin was separated from both his father and mother and was raised by his grandfather, Mirsaid Sharif, the imam of the Ruhobod Mosque. During this time, he started to learn writing, and under the guidance of his grandfather, he began to study Arabic language rules and religious sciencLater, after getting acquainted with the renowned educator Sayidahmad Vasliy (in 1900), he had the opportunity to further develop his knowledge. Vasliy not only taught him Arabic grammar but also inspired him with a love for literature, which aligned him with the enlightened intellectuals of his time. In 1901, Hoji Muin began his teaching activities in the old school, and as a result of specific experiences and under the influence of Abdulkadir Shakuri's school, he opened his own new-style school in the Khodja Nisbatdor neighborhood in 1903. That same year, with the request of Vasliy, he translated several poems from Turkish to Persian, which later were published under the title 'Guldastai adabiyot' ('Bouquet of Literature') by M. Behbudiy.Hoji Muin also wrote textbooks among the ranks of the Jadid educators. In 1908, he wrote the book 'Rahnamoi savod' in Russian and, together with I. Rahmatullazoda, created 'O'qituvchi,' an alphabet book in Uzbek. He also translated several poems from Turkish to Persian upon A. Shakuri's request and later compiled them in the collection 'Guldastai adabiyot.' This collection included his original poems as well as translations.Hoji Muin started to write his own plays shortly after publishing Mahmudxo'ja Behbudiy's 'Padarkush' in the press. In the play 'Eski maktab, yangi maktab' ('Old School, New School'), he portrayed the difference between the old-style and new-style schools' educational systems. In plays like 'To'y,' 'Ko'knori,' and 'Mazluma xotin,' he criticized negative habits that persisted among the people. He also wrote plays like 'Maorif qurbonlari,' 'Juvonbozlik qurbonlari,' 'Boy ila xizmatkor,' and 'Qozi ila muallim.",

      "Aside from his literary works, Hoji Muin was actively involved in journalism. Between 1907 and 1937, he contributed around 200 articles, 400 news items, and nearly 1500 lines of poetry to 23 different newspapers and journals in Uzbek and Tajik languages. He was the founder and chief editor of the newspaper 'Mehnatkashlar tovushi' ('The Voice of Labor') and was involved in organizing journals like 'Tayoq' and 'Mashrab.' Hoji Muin also translated Abdurauf Fitrat's work 'Hindistonda bir farangi bilan buxoroli bir mudarrisning jadid maktablari xususinda qilg'on munozarasi' from Russian to Uzbek, which was published in 1912.However, his fate was not as favorable as some of his contemporaries. In 1929, during the purges, he was among the first to face persecution. Until 1932, he lived in difficult conditions, and then he was arrested. In January 1938, he was arrested again and later died in a labor camp in Solikamsk in 1942.",
