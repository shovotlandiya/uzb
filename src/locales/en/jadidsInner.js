      "Abdulla Qadiri is a bright, widely known poet and writer, playwright and publicist, the founder of the novel genre in Uzbek literature. Kadiri's works are dedicated to the life of the Uzbek people. Based on an unpublished play by Abdulla Qadiri written in the twenties of the 20th century, director Mark Weil staged the stage play 'The White Black Stork' at Ilhom Theater in Tashkent. Abdulla Qadiri (Julqunboy) was born in Tashkent in 1894 in a wealthy merchant family. The environment of his youth and adolescence consisted of merchants, rich and poor farmers, talented artisans, artisans who lived in poverty and landless peasants. This world of hard-working people, as well as urban intellectuals, played an important role in the formation of the future writer. Abdulla lived a long time from his youth (Aka Kadir lived 102 years) and listened to the stories of his father, who had seen a lot. from his father he inherited a sensitive observation that he used in his literary work. His father was very fond of horticulture, which is why Qadiri thinks that he is the son of a gardener. Abdulla Qadiri first studied at the Muslim school (1904-1906), then at the Russian-Tuzem school (1908-1012) and successfully graduated. By 1912, Abdulla Qadiri's first literary experiments began. In his first published works - the stories 'Khotinboz' (1915) and 'Bachtsiz Kuyov' (1915) - the lines of the old Uzbek life are humorously expressed. From 1915 to 1917, he diligently studied Arabic and Persian at the Madrasa of Qadiri Abdul Qasim. The influence of Jadidism can be felt in the writer's works before the revolution. During the Soviet period, A. Kadiri V. Ya. He studied at Moscow literary courses named after Bryusov (1924-1925), then in 1925-1926 he worked in Tashkent, in the Uzbek comic magazine 'Mushtum'. Comic stories and feuilletons of the creator, who have received great success among readers, are published there. Kadiri's novels and short stories ('Otgan kunlar', 'Scorpion from the Altar'), as well as collective works (the short story 'Obid Ketmon') are dedicated to the life of Uzbeks from Tashkent and Kokan in the 19th century. The novel 'Bygone Days' has gained great fame. All intellectuals tried to read this book. And even illiterate people gathered in groups to listen to him. In many Uzbek families, the names of the heroes of the novel, Otabek and Kumush, began to appear. Abdullah Qadiri was persecuted. On December 31, 1937, he was arrested as an 'enemy of the people' by jealous 'fellow writers'. On October 4, 1938, the writer was shot and acquitted after his death. He was buried in Khoja Alambardar (Kamolon) cemetery in Tashkent. A. After Kadiri's death, whoever saw the novel 'The Past Days' in his book, they were imprisoned. Then the situation changed... 1957 Abdulla Qadiri was officially acquitted. But the fact that he was shot (like the fact that he was acquitted after his death) was kept secret for many years! Thus, in 1958, when the novel 'The Past Days' was translated into Russian, a biography was written on it without any information about the death of Abdulla Qadiri. The author of the biography is the well-known writer Izzat Sultanov. Unfamiliar information is provided for the biography of the novel 'The Scorpion from the Altar' in Russian. It is written briefly: 'Abdulla Qadiri died in 1939'. Based on Abdullah Qadiri's unpublished play written in black ink in the 1930s, Mark Weil staged the play 'The White Stork' at his Ilhom Theater in Tashkent.",

      "In 1901, he established a new school in the village of Rajabamin near the city of Samarkand. Arithmetic and natural science were taught in this new school. In the new method school he opened, Shakuri pays close attention to teaching the rules and letters of the Arabic language, introduces students to syllables, and based on these syllables, makes simple words that children can understand. From the first day of study, Shakuri would write syllables in a notebook and teach them to read and write. Then the teacher divided the syllables into letters and made new syllables from these letters. In this way, the child was taught to read and write for five to six months. Then the textbook 'Rahnamoi savod' ('Leader of Literacy') created by Shakuri and his student Ismatulla Rahmatullaev based on the sound-letter method was taught. , in order to provide preliminary information on manners and rules of life, creates the second book entitled 'Jameul-hikayat' ('Collection of Stories'). This book is a term book for II, III grades of primary school. The book contains 48 short stories on the topic of etiquette and 15 poetic works. His third reading book is called 'Zub-datul Ash'ar'. The author's main goal in creating this textbook was to improve and strengthen the students' acquired knowledge, to arouse in them a desire to study poetry and to introduce them to examples of (Uzbek, Tajik, Azerbaijani) classical literature. Shakuri organized a general exam for his students once a year. At the exam, he would demonstrate the results of the knowledge acquired by his students during six months in front of parents, supporters of the new method school and enemies - mullahs and rich people. These public examinations organized at the school took the form of 'General Court'. People came to the exam in droves, everyone was surprised to see that in a short period of time the children became literate, had knowledge of arithmetic, geography and natural sciences. As a result, supporters of this school grew more and more. Shakuri himself writes about it like this: 'One day I invited prominent scholars, agniyas and ayans of the city, as well as the fathers of the students, to the exam held on the six-month study of children. . In front of them, the students took an exam on the six months of knowledge they had acquired at school. People saw the benefits of this teaching method and were pleased with me.",

      "After the exam, love for the school appeared in people's hearts, and their faces opened. It should be noted that the popularity of the new method school opened by Shakuri and the fame of the textbooks created by Hamza Hakimzada Niyazi, Sadriddin Ainiy, Mirza Abdulvahid Munzi and other enlighteners also attracted the attention of fighters. In 1909, Hamza came to Samarkand to visit Shakuri's school and take part in his exams. The study-teaching methods and exam results in this school made a great impression on Hamza Hakimzada Niyazi. Rejecting all teaching methods and reading books, in order to facilitate literacy, he first uses the syllable method, and later the sound-letter method. As a result of the ease of this teaching method, students would be literate in 6 months at the most. Secondly, he introduced the method of teaching young boys and girls together in the school. Thirdly, he insisted on teaching children first in their mother tongue and at the same time encouraged them to learn Uzbek, Tajik, Arabic and Russian languages perfectly. Fourthly, he created and published textbooks in a very simple, understandable language for the schools of the new method. Fifth, the first innovation introduced by Shakuri was the introduction of labor and music lessons in Samarkand schools. In addition to introducing his students to agricultural and horticultural work, he also taught bookmaking, carpentry and other crafts, and allocated separate hours for these activities from the school program.",

Mahmudhoja Behbudi, the leader of the militant movement, that is, a new educational methodology, was born on January 20, 1875 in the city of Samarkand in the family of muftis. The environment in which Bekhbudi grew up did not have any effect on his worldview. Mahmudhoja's father was a major specialist in Islam and wrote a number of articles on religion and conducted scientific work, so this important environment influenced the worldview of the boy. It was not a secret. Along with literature and history, he also studied politics. He got acquainted with the news happening in the world through newspapers and magazines. His travels to Mecca, Egypt and Istanbul completely changed his outlook. He established cooperation with newspapers and magazines and started publishing his articles, in which he raised the issues of school and art improvement. was Mahmudkhoja is the author of more than 200 publications in Uzbek and Tajik languages. In particular, 'Muntakhabi geography' - 'Brief general geography' (1903), 'Kitab-ul-atfol' - 'Children's book' (1904) and others. The foundation point of Bekhbudi's writing is the drama 'Padarkush' written in Samarkand in 1911. It states that the young generation should be educated and cultured. The drama was first published in Turon newspaper in 1912, and in 1913 it was published in the form of a separate book. From the compositional point of view, the work looks simple, but the idea is very complex and can meet all the requirements of the drama genre. Behbudi was the first swallow of Uzbek dramaturgy and inspired the creation of A. Qadiri's 'Bachtsiz Kuyov', Mirmukhsina-Fikriya's 'Childless Boy' and a number of works by Hamza. He was executed according to the order of Olijan. Sadriddin Ainy wrote in connection with the tragic death of Alloma: 'The name of the brave poet Behbudi is mentioned with respect in the Muslim East, because for 20 years he taught all beings who knew the value of their consciousness and human dignity to free life, light and called for the struggle for enlightenment'. The city of Karshi was named after Behbudi in 1920-1930. Behbudi's name was repressed in 1937 and exonerated in 1956. Today, the rich and colorful literary, cultural and educational heritage left by the Allama serves the independence of his people. In 1977, Behbudi's 'Saylanma' was published. This collection included textbooks and study guides, and today streets and schools are named after him.",

    text1:
      "Abdurauf Fitrat occupies an important place in the history of our literature as a poet and scientist, prose writer and dramatist, teacher and enlightener. He was born in Bukhara in 1886 in an intellectual family, studied in Bukhara and Istanbul madrasas and dorilfunun. Due to his perfect knowledge of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages, he is able to master the works of the great scholars of the East. Adib's father was a merchant and remained in Kashkar until 1918. He was mainly raised by his mother Mustafa Bibi (Bibijan), from whom he first listened to the ghazals of great poets such as Navoi, Uvaisi, Zebunnisa, Bedil, Fuzuli. Fitrat went to study in Turkey in 1909 and studied at Istanbul Dorilfunu until 1913. He was active in the 'Bukhara Education Maarif' association established in Turkey. Behbudi served to improve the modern schools founded by him. His first collection was published in 1911 under the name 'Sayha' ('Chorlov'). Works such as 'Traveler Hindi', 'Munozara' were also published in these years. In 1909-1913, while studying at the Turkish Medical University, his intelligence and knowledge impressed the professors. They give him the nickname Fitrat - Wise. Fitrat's work corresponds to the times when the revolutionary movements intensified in Turkestan, and the 'East woke up'. Like his predecessors, he puts forward the ideas of enlightenment. In his work titled 'Discussion' written in Tajik in 1913, it can be felt that he saved his people from the mire of oppression and searched for a 'salvation path'. During this period, promotion of the Russian language and Russian culture was also an important branch of Fitrat's enlightenment. Such views are widely promoted in the 'Hurriyat' newspaper, which he founded and edited. In the same years, the slogan 'The first issue on the way of life is the issue of school' ('Hurriyat', 1917, issue 1) comes out. In his 'Sorrow of the Country...' published in 'Hurriyat' newspaper (1917, issue 31), he says that he decided to fight for Turkestan and the freedom of its women. 'I was born for you, I live for you, I die for you, O holy hearth of your kind!' call is heard. In the newspaper 'Ulug' Turkistan' (1917, issue 2) it appeared with the slogan 'Long live Turkey, long live Islam'. In his works such as 'Indian revolutionaries', 'Timur's saga', 'Oghiz Khan', 'Abo Muslim', 'Turkish language', prejudices and views are visible. Among them, such dramas as 'Blood', 'Begijan', 'Chin Sevish', 'Tolqin', 'Vose's Rebellion', 'Rozalar' were created. The search process can be seen in Fitrat's poems such as 'Night', 'Looking for Behbudi Mazarini', 'Sharq', which were included in the collection 'Uzbek poets' published in 1922. In the poem 'The Poet' he concludes that 'I have made many hopes for myself.' In his poem 'Kim deyay seni' written in 1920, the lover's longing, waiting, kissing with great hope for the beloved is sung in a lyrical tone, which indicates that the poet is now rising to a new level of creativity. In the work of the poet, there is a shift in his worldview, a desire for innovation and beauty. The same situation can be felt in the idea of his dramas such as 'Abulfayzkhan', 'Arslon' and 'Vose' (in Tajik). In his prose works such as 'Doomsday', 'Satan's Rebellion to God', the deepening of the creator's philosophy and his desire to solve major social and life problems can be seen. Fitrat also created a number of works as a great scientist and literary critic. In particular, scientific observations such as 'Rules of Literature', 'Samples of Old Uzbek Literature', 'About Aruz' play an important role in the history of the science of literature. Also, his studies on Umar Khayyam, Firdawsi, Navoi, Bedil, M. Salih, Muqimi, Furqat also serve as an important source in the study of the history of our literature. He wrote articles about more than ten representatives of classical literature, such as Ahmad Yassavi and Sulayman Bakirgani. At the same time, Fitrat worked actively as a scientist, great pedagogue, organizer of public education.",

      "Sadriddin Ainiy is a writer, scientist and public figure of Uzbek and Tajik literature of the 20th century. Ainiy carried out research work in Uzbek and Tajik literature as a historian, literary critic and scientist. Novels about poets and scientists such as Rudaki, ibn Sina, Sa'di, Vasifi, Bedil, Navoi, Ahmed Donish, were born in the summer of 1878 in the village of Soktari, Gijduvan district, Bukhara region. His father was a mill foreman, and his grandfather was a mullah. At the age of six, his father sent Sadriddin to a school near the mosque. However, the school teacher was illiterate, so the father took his son from this school and placed him in the school for women of Bibi Khalifa, the wife of the village mullah. Nevertheless, after graduating from school, he knew how to read and write. Syed Akbar, who studied in Bukhara, taught him to read. Sadriddin lost his uncle, father and mother when smallpox spread in 1889. His elder brother Muhyiddin becomes a mullah in another village, and an eleven-year-old boy takes care of his younger brother and becomes the head of the family. He fed and clothed his brothers, traded in the market and tilled the land. In 1890, Sharifjon Makhdum helped him go to Bukhara, where he studied at the Mir Arab madrasa. Sadriddin was more interested in poetry than the books taught in the madrasa. At the beginning of 1892, Sharifjon Makhdum invited him to live in his house. In this house, people close to literature and art used to meet, have conversations and read books. At that time, he wrote poems under different pseudonyms. He received the nickname 'Ainy' in 1896. After becoming a famous poet in 1905, his poems were included in the collection of selected works. He wrote textbooks for 'new-style' schools (local) in the 'Marifat' society, which was established at that time. Due to his closeness to the ancients, in 1915 he was suspected and persecuted, and he had to hide from the government and work in a cotton factory. . Nevertheless, in 1916, Ayni was unexpectedly called to become a mudarris at one of the biggest madrasas in Bukhara, Hiyobon, but he refused the offer. On April 8, 1917, because of the changes in Bukhara, Jadidists organized a demonstration. Mass arrests begin. As a real 'hurfikr', he was punished by whipping 75 times and imprisoned in the 'Obkhona' prison, from which no one came out alive. He was saved by the Russians. One of his brothers, Sirojiddin, was executed by the emir's sentence, and Muhyiddin was killed by the press. Sadriddin Ainiy felt sorry for the Bolsheviks, wrote poems on the topic of the revolution, which were widely known to the public, and helped in revolutionary speeches in Bukhara. In 1920, he got married and went to Samarkand with his wife. After the revolutionary victory, he taught at school for some time, and then he was completely engaged in literary activities. During the Soviet period, he was mainly engaged in literary activities. In 1929, he was elected a member of the Central Election Commission of the Tajik SSR, and in 1934, he was elected a member of the leadership of the Union of Writers of the USSR. Honored scientist of the Tajik SSR (1940), honorary member of the FA of the Uzbek SSR (1949), doctor of philology (1949). From 1951, he was the first president of the FA of the Tajik SSR. The first laureate of the State Prize of Tajikistan (1950). Sadriddin Ainiy, along with Tajik, his mother tongue, also knew Uzbek well and wrote some of his works in this language. He made a significant contribution to the literature of both nations. His main works are: 'Odina' (published in 1924), 'Dokhunda' (published in 1930), 'Slaves' (1934), 'Death of a Moneylender' (1939), 'Memories' ('Bukhara') (1949-1954). The story 'Odina' is considered the beginning of new Tajik literature. The writer D. Ikromiy said, 'All of us were formed through 'Odina'...'. 'Dokhunda' shows the development of the author in the stream of social realism. If Odina is a passive hero, then Dokhunda is an active participant in the revolution. 'Slaves' is the first Tajik novel depicting the time of Central Asia from the 1930s to the 20th century. In 'The Death of the Usurer', the life of the hypocrite and greedy Kori Ishkamb is combined with that of Plyushkin, Yudushka Golovlyov, and Gobsek. at the same time, it reflected the national character of the Tajik people. 'Memories' is a collection of short stories about childhood and youth, revealing the life of Bukhara between those centuries. They were highly appreciated by writers such as Leonid Leonov and Konstantin Fedin, as well as in Iran. Samuil Marshak and Antanas Ventslovas also appreciated the work of the master. Louis Aragon compared him to Jack London and the Kiplings. At the conference of Asian and African writers held in Cairo in 1962, Rabindranath Tagore, Lu Hsin, Taha Husayn, etc., were placed in a row with classical Eastern writers.

      "The writer D. Ikromi said: “We all were formed through Odin…”. 'Dokhunda' shows the development of the author in line with socialist realism. If Odin is a passive hero, then Dokhunda is an active participant in the revolution. 'Slaves' is the first Tajik novel depicting the time of Central Asia in the 1930s - 20th century. In 'Death of a Usurer' the life of the hypocrite and greedy Corey Ishkamb is combined with the life of Plyushkin, Yudushka Golovlev, and Gobsek, at the same time reflecting the national character of the Tajik people. 'Memories' is a collection of stories about childhood and youth, revealing the life of Bukhara between these centuries. They were highly praised by writers such as Leonid Leonov and Konstantin Fedin, as well as in Iran. Samuil Marshak and Antanas Venclovas also highly appreciated the master's work. Louis Aragon compared him to Jack London and the Kiplings. At the conference of Asian and African writers held in Cairo in 1962, Rabindranath Tagore, Lu Sin, Taha Hussein, and others were placed on a par with the classics of the East. Aini's works have been translated into Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, French, and Urdu. The author of works on the history and literature of Central Asia compiled the Tajik national creative collection 'Samples of Tajik Literature', which included the best examples of poetry from Sanalad Rudaki to the beginning of the 20th century. With this publication, Ainy proved the existence of Tajiks as a separate nation. The poet himself said that 'the work, based on historical evidence, removed suspicions based on violence and research on pan-Turks, and fixed them ...'. In this regard, a conflict arose between him and Faizulla Khodzhaev. Pan-Turkism received support from above at the beginning of the 20th century, because the USSR was interested in good relations with Turkey. Despite such accusations (for example, the accusation by N. I. Bukharin), Aini does not recognize Soviet power. In 1941, Aini participated in the opening of the tomb of the Timurids, as well as the great founder of classical poetry Rudaki. Met with Stalin, Maxim Gorky, Yakub Kolas, Julius Fuchiklar Saidirddin Ainy died on July 15, 1954 in Stalinabad, now Dushanbe.",

Haji Muin was born on March 19, 1883 in Samarkand. His father, Shukrullo, was a merchant and died at the age of 32. Mirsaid Sharif, the grandfather of Haji Muin Ruhabad Guzari, who lost both his father and mother at the age of twelve, is the imam of the mosque. During this period, he became literate and learned the rules of the Arabic language and religious sciences under the tutelage of his grandfather. Wasli not only taught him the rules of the Arabic language, but also strengthened his love for poetry, at the same time, he brought him into the circle of enlightened people of his time. Haji Muin started teaching in the old school in 1901. As a result of certain experiences in this field and, of course, under the influence of Abduqadir Shakuri's school, in 1903 he opened a new school in Khoja Nisbatdar neighborhood. In the same year, his acquaintance with Mahmudhoja Behbudi at Vasli's house opened a new era in his life. In particular, Behbudi's work entitled 'General geography of Mukhtasari' made a great impression on Haji Muin. Among the teachers of Jadid, Haji Muin also wrote and published textbooks.

Shakuri, wrote several books of educational value for children. translates poems from Turkish to Persian. Later, with the support of M. Behbudi, he published them in the form of a collection under the name 'Guldastai Liyatari'. He also included his poems in this collection.
