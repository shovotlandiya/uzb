      "<p>In 1991, on August 31st, the Uzbek people achieved Independence, a long-awaited dream. In all aspects of our lives, including museum activities, significant historical changes took place. According to the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers on April 21, 1992, the State Museum of Uzbekistan's history was reorganized. In terms of content and essence, it became the basis for a modern and national museum. The President's Decree on 'Improving and Developing Museum Activities' (January 12, 1998) further promoted the advancement of our museuCurrently, the State Museum of Uzbekistan's history is considered one of the largest scientific and educational centers, housing over 250,000 exhibits. Among them, there are valuable collections related to numismatics, archaeology, philately, and ethnography.</p><p>The new exposition of the State Museum of Uzbekistan presents evidence and visual materials reflecting the development of historical and cultural processes in Uzbekistan from ancient times to the present. With an area of nearly two thousand square meters, the exhibition is distributed over the third and fourth floors of the building and showcases more than ten thousand exhibits. It illustrates the formation of Uzbek statehood, the traditions and culture of the Uzbek people.</p>The exhibits that represent the early period in the first section provide evidence of the Uzbek people's encounters with ancient civilizations such as the Achaemenids, Greeks-Macedonians, and Sogdians, as well as information about the Bactrians, the state of Fergana, and the Kushan Empire. These historical interactions are well illustrated in the museum.Particular attention is paid to the cultural heritage of the Uzbek people in the Middle Ages, which is also well represented in the exposition. Especially, in the exposition dedicated to Timur and the Timurids, numerous exhibits tell the story of Timur's military campaigns, the development of science and culture during his reign.The high level of development of craftsmanship in the 18th and 19th centuries is illustrated by various exhibits of applied art, including ceramics, metalwork, Bukhara carpets, adras fabrics, and embroidery.",

      "Moreover, the achievements of our country, especially the victories in the political, economic, and social spheres achieved during the relatively short period of independence, are highlighted in the final section of the museum. In just 14 years, Uzbekistan has risen to a respectable position among other countries in the world. In short, the exhibition showcases the historical development and cultural progress, presenting a unified and glorious history of the nation. Human beings come to this world once. The goodness that one brings into existence will never be forgotten. Kindness is eternal. Therefore, just like our ancestors, we also have to create a worthy legacy for the future generations. As our President, Islam Karimov, said: 'If our children and future generations feel as grateful to us as we do to our great ancestors for their tireless dedication in building and preserving this sacred land and nation, then fulfilling all our duties is our civic responsibility.",

      "<p>In 1927, an exhibition showcasing the finest works of Uzbek craftsmen was organized. It was then turned into a permanent exhibition called the 'Exhibition of Uzbek Folk Art.' The exhibits collected annually included various artifacts, such as carved wooden products, ceramics, jewelry, fabrics, and other examples of traditional folk art. In 1937, on July 7th, this collection of folk art masterpieces was displayed at the 'Craftsmanship Museum' in TashkeIn 1960, the museum received the name 'Permanent Exhibition of Uzbek Applied Art.' Later, in 1997, the former exhibition was transferred to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Uzbekistan and acquired the status of the 'State Applied Art Museum.'Today, the museum's treasure houses invaluable examples of applied art created by skillful artisans from the first half of the 19th century to the present day.</p><p> The collection of applied art pieces can be divided into three main groups. First, there are artifacts related to schools that were created based on ancient traditions, each displaying its unique characteristics. Second, there are works developed from traditional styles but transformed and embellished with original designs and artistic elements in the second half of the 20th century. The third group consists of contemporary art pieces, which have been enriched with colorful motifs and meet modern art standards.The artifacts in the museum's collection are divided into 20 separate collections and are displayed in exhibitions dedicated to various themes.Uzbek folk art is renowned worldwide for its ancient artistic traditions.</p> The craftsmanship of exquisite products is considered among the oldest forms of Uzbek art. Rare examples of folk artistry, including clay pottery, embroidery, jewelry-making, weaving, metalworking, carpet-making, silk and cotton fabrics, embroidery, wood carving, and many other forms of applied art, are well-preserved in our museums. President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, I.A. Karimov, once said, 'We recognize our nation not by its name but through its culture, spirituality, and until the end of history, we will look at its deepest layers.' In reality, the invaluable treasures of material and spiritual heritage preserved in our museums are solid evidence of our existence. During the years of independence, particular attention has been given to the improvement of museum activities.The adoption of two resolutions by the Cabinet of Ministers in 1994 and 1998, the establishment of the 'Uzbekmuseum' association, and the organization of various museums such as the State Museum of Uzbekistan's history, the Temurid history state museum, the 'Memorial of Broken Souls' in Karakalpakstan, and archeological museums in Termiz serve as a vivid testament to this fact. The Presidential Decree of January 12, 1998, on 'Improving and Developing Museum Activities,' emphasized the need to further enhance the system of museums created in Uzbekistan from ancient times, to make their position more prominent in the spiritual and moral heritage of the people, to enrich the exhibition funds with rare and unique exhibits, to study, preserve, and demonstrate these artifacts to the world, and to extensively use them in awakening the national pride and spirit of independence, love for the motherland and loyalty.",

      "The State Museum of Applied Art of the Republic holds the most unique and valuable artifacts of our national culture. The museum's exhibitions present over 50 types of folk applied art. It is well-known that throughout the centuries, Uzbekistan has been the birthplace of great centers of folk artistic craftsmanship, with each region distinguished by its own unique artistic style. In particular, Cceramics, Rishton pottery, Margilan silk fabrics, Bukhara gold embroidery, and Shakhrisabz embroidery are among the most famous.When you walk through the museum's halls, you will witness miraculous creations crafted by human hands and revel in the beauty of exquisite artistic craftsmanship, making you feel a boundless admiration for the world of art.",
